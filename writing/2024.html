    <h1>2024</h1>
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
    <p>My goal this year was to focus and make sales on a hardware/software project. I silently launched, focused on marketing toward a niche via regular tiktok and IG videos and made a few new sales attempts.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>I chose only one goal this year.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grow a direct-to-consumer (DTC) hardware/software project üç¨ ‚úÖ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You might already know the project, but I'm not ready to link it here. If you want to know what it is, DM me on any channel.</p>
    <p>Unlike previous years, I only chose one dollar goal to focus on. The biggest reason was because I wouldn't (soft) launch the project until late in the year (October) and didn't want the product to stagnate in that time.</p>
	<p>Here's everything I've done to grow the project so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Posted videos promoting creators on Tiktok and IG</li>
		<li>Made sales on TikTok shop</li>
        <li>Made sales on main product website</li>
        <li>Made sales in-person (busking on Venice and Abbott Kinney)</li>
        <li>Sent promo units / demos to interested buyers</li>
        <li>Cold emailed prospects with highly-tailored gif emails</li>
        <li>Sold units on consigment at local market</li>        
    </ul>
    <p>I'll discuss each of those points below, but if you want my other 2024 updates scroll deeper.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Audience building on Tiktok and IG</h3>
    <p>With my other projects, I've launched them by...</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Posting on socials</li>
    	<li>Doing the ProductHunt dance asking for upvotes</li>
    	<li>Posting on HN</li>
    	<li>Emailing my tinyletter subscribers</li>
        <li>...hope for the best</li>
	</ul>
    <p>This new product is physical and has two niche buyer personas, so it merits a different strategy.</p>
    <p>Buyer persona #1: fans of indie music and the artists they follow.</p>
    <p>Buyer persona #2: event planners, exhibition vendors, swag vendors.</p>
    <p>For person #1, I went to where solo artists and bands are slinging there content and got into the mix. Remember, I wasn't ready to announce the product until October, so I started promoting an idea <strong>adjascent</strong> to my product while also promoting indie artists. People have called this "side-product" marketing: promote something that promotes your main thing. NYT owning Wordle is a good example of this (albeit through acquisition).</p>
    <p>Each post required lots of curation (sifting through songs rarely played, by indie and indie-ish artists) and physically making the product to promote them and my product. Time consuming and so long as I was enjoying the music, it was fun.</p>
    <p>I'm going to continue posting in 2025, but need to figure out the new format. The videos really are time intensive and I think I get more leverage growing persona #2.</p>
    <h3>Made sales on TikTok shop</h3>
    <p>This was nowhere on my radar at the start of 2024. I thought integrating with TitTok was prohibitive based on their 2-day fulfillment policy. I was wrong.</p>
    <p><em>"But what if I'm out of town for the weekend and can't fulfill an order?</em> Temporarily decrease inventory to 0. Product shop links still appear on videos but with zero inventory, if anything it creates some FOMO</p></p>
    <p>The biggest pain is the lack of customization on TikTok shop. My product is sort of "made-to-print", but the workarounds are fine. It hasn't stopped the banner guy from selling custom banner prints either.</p>
    <p>I'm continuing TikTok shop next year if it's still around. I'll also explore IG shop links and possibly Amazon. Little by little.</p>
    <h3>Made sales on the main product website</h3>
    <p>Before opening the TikTok shop, I simply had a link in bio to the website. That yielded some sales but not suprisingly, TikTop prefers sales to go through their shop.</p>
    <p>The site's purchase process is pretty smooth but could use some native gesture handling on mobile. That'll get updated when the product gets added in 2025.</p>
    <h3>Made sales in-person</h3>
    <p>This was fun. Part of my video hook is a costume I wear. It starts the conversation and sometimes leads to a follow, DM, or sale.</p>
    <p>It works while busking in Venice, CA too. "Peacocking" I heard from a fan of the product</p>
    <p>I spent about 4 hours standing, yelling a loopable phrase to draw people into a demo, answering questions and making sales. It was great and a totally different mindsent then the "fire and forget" style marketing of digital media. While digital efforts compound, we're also at the mercy of algorithms or SEO hacking.</p>
    <p>Good ol' yelling your product and price at strangers on the beach still works.</p>
    <p>I'm doing this more in 2025. Shoutout to the breakdancers who are out there regularly who love the product and told me the best days/months to busk.</p>
    <h3>Sent promo units</h3>
    <p>I sent a dozen promo units to prospects. The most time intensive was to Qatar which required custom DHL tracking. A few hoops to jump through but overall worth it.</p>
    <p>Next year I'll do this more, but only with big vendors like Qatar.</p>
    <h3>Cold email</h3>
    <p>I'm still in the "highly tailored, individual cold emails" club, though I'm flirting with building more of an automated solution with manual lead curation via lead databases.</p>
    <p>By "highly tailored", I mean I...made a custom product for the prospect's brand, recorded a video, made a gif of that video demo, attached the gif in an email, linked it to a video.</p>
    <p>It's a great loop actually and I suspect doesn't have the penalties bulk-emailer products are getting with pixel/link tracking.</p>
    <p>More on this in the new year...</p>
    <h3>Consignment sales</h3>
    <p>"Hold my product and if it sells, you get X%"</p>
    <p>This should really be a constraint for any idea I try to grow: "can I grow it with consigned sales?"</p>
    <p>I dismissed this idea earlier in the year, but after the sale of pre-made (not "made-to-print") products while busking, it was an easy experiment to run.</p>
    <br />
    <h1>Non-goal-based great things of 2024</h1>
	<ul>
        <li>Ran a half marathon. Ran 174 miles over 50 sessions.</li>
        <li>Four vacations taken, excluding trips to Mexico</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
                
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Next year, I'm going to make more of these types of sales.</p>
    
    <h2>Next year</h2>
    <p>This year, I have fun goals. More running, more writing, a fun DTC product, and being more present.</p>
    <p>If you have a resolution, I&apos;ll <a href="/yearlydollargoals" target="_blank">give you $1</a> if you finish it in 2024. ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

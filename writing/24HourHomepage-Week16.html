<a id="user-content--overview" class="anchor" href="#-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># Overview</h3>
<p>Over the last two weeks— in my effort to make the best 24-hour “movie” on the internet and get better at sales and marketing along the way — I reached out to more bloggers, podcasters and journalists. As <a href="/24hourhomepage-com-week-15-is-this-a-matrix-df41505ac2de">I mentioned before</a>, I aggregated a huge list of podcasts to reach out to but only pinged 25 of them. I wanted to wait until my talk at JS.LA was posted as I think it provides some good additional context in the cold email.</p>
<p>As I pitched more journalists, I learned more about the pitching process in general.</p>
<p>Also<span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm"><span id="user-content-rmm">,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> in my research, I discovered a pretty cool podcast that led to my first paid promotion of the site.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content--podcasts" class="anchor" href="#-podcasts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># Podcasts</h3>
<p>I was interviewed on 3 more podcasts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.digitalintrovertspodcast.com/" rel="nofollow">Digital Introverts</a> — A show about introverts sharing their successes and failures and how they thrive in the digital age.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://juniortosenior.io" rel="nofollow">Junior to Senior</a> — A weekly show for junior engineers who want to level up their game featuring conversations with tech leads, senior engineers and CTOs.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/thingz-of-that-nature" rel="nofollow">Thingz of that Nature</a>—Rockshana Desances is a great host and chats with people all around the world about what motivates and inspires them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these experiences was great and reminded me that even with the laser focus I have on growing <a href="https://24hourhomepage.com/" rel="nofollow">24hourhomepage</a>, there are loads of dimensions worth talking about on this journey.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content--update-jsla-talk" class="anchor" href="#-update-jsla-talk" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># Update: JS.LA talk</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, remember that talk I gave at JS.LA last month? Well, it’s now posted on youtube for you to check out again!</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content--paid-mediaa-story" class="anchor" href="#-paid-mediaa-story" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># Paid Media…a story</h3>
<p>Apparently in marketing-speak there are 3 common types of media you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>owned</li>
<li>earned</li>
<li>paid</li>
</ul>
<p>Owned media is any content you, the business <strong>owner</strong>, distribute. <strong>Earned</strong> media is when someone else creates content about you without your participation. Aka “free press”. <strong>Paid</strong> media is content you pay to be created and/or distributed.</p>
<p>While I was researching interesting journalists to eventually reach out to, I discovered and followed</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HeyHeyESJ">Eric Johnson</a> and his podcast <a href="https://followfridaypodcast.com/" rel="nofollow">Follow Friday</a>. The show is great. Each week, Eric sits down with a writer/podcaster/comedian to discuss who they follow online and why. Some great conversations and learnings in there.</p>
<p>Anyway, Eric independently discovered <a href="https://24hourhomepage.com" rel="nofollow">24hourhomepage</a>, joined and later tweeted out these <a href="https://twitter.com/HeyHeyESJ/status/1403119099119431691">kind words.</a></p>
<p>At this point we’re both smitten with each other’s products. We set up a call where he tells me about sponsorship opportunities for his podcast and I jump.</p>
<p>I’ve steered away from “paid media” because I’m operating on a shoestring budget and hadn’t found the right channel. A show about interesting people on the internet? Well, that’s the Goldilocks zone for sure.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://followfridaypodcast.com/" rel="nofollow">Follow Friday</a> anywhere you get your podcasts and listen this week for the 24hourhomepage sponsorship!</p>

<a id="user-content--pitching-journalists" class="anchor" href="#-pitching-journalists" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># Pitching journalists</h3>
<p>So with 1% of the day sold, I figured now would be a good time to start reaching out to journalists. Bloggers, newsletter writers, reporters…anyone who likes to tell stories of internet culture. If you’ve ever seen a journalist’s twitter profile you may have read a call out to send them “tips”. Here’s what I’ve learned about the whole “tipping” process:</p>
<p>“tips” — can be anything a journalist can use in a story. Maybe some hidden dimension not yet reported, maybe some exclusive information only you have access to.</p>
<p>“pitches” — are generally more like a full story. The who, what, where, why, when and hows of a full story. Sometimes the full story is even written for the journalist in question.</p>
<p>“press releases” — are short articles regularly distributed in hopes of having a journalist repost or retell the news.</p>
<p>Some marketers had recommended I use the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/" rel="nofollow">PR Newswire tool</a> but it comes with too steep a price for this bootstrapper. For now, I’m hitting newsrooms and journalists directly.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content--this-week" class="anchor" href="#-this-week" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a># This week</h3>
<p>I’m going to reach out to local newsrooms. Not just online journalists but local tv and radio stations. I’ll also reach out to the rest of my podcast list.</p>

<p><strong>Question for you:</strong> What is your favorite podcast?</p>

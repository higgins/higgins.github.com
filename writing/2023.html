    <h1>2023</h1>
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
    <p>This year, my goals around money were a success but those
    around fitness, less so. My wife became a licensed architect and
    and we welcomed 4 babies of friends and family into the world.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>My dollar goals were to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sell truck and trailer 🛻 ✅</li>
      <li>Write a P&L report every month 👨‍🏫 ✅</li>
      <li>Add an index to this website 🧮 ✅</li>
      <li>Save $X dollars 🪙 ✅</li>
      <li>Perform 150 Stronglift 5x5 workouts 🏋️‍♂ 🚫</li>
      <li>Log my efforts for 24HourHomepage 🪵 🚫</li>
      <li>Confidently climb V4 holds 🧗‍♂️ 🚫</li>
      <li>Wake up every day before 5:30am 😴 🚫</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A summary of what I learned is below</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Write P&L report every month</h3>
    <p>I&apos;m most proud of this goal so I&apos;ll start with it. </p>
    <p>Every month, I created a basic report of our previous months finances. I printed it and we discussed anything worth calling out. We&apos;ll continue this practice as we find its a peaceful way to approach our savings and a spendings goals.</p>
    <h3>Save money</h3>
    <p>Enabled by the P&L goal, we wanted to hit a dollar mark in our savings. We did. Feels good.</p>
    <h3>Truck and Trailer</h3>
    <p>We bought a truck and trailer a few years ago in hopes of building out a small ranch property in Mexico. That opportunity fell through and the trailer became a paperweight. The truck, to a lesser degree as we used it for beach trips. It still felt unnecessary.</p>
    <p>When we made the decision to sell, it was simply a matter of patience. Thankfully, we were not time-pressured to sell.</p>
    <h3>Indexing this site</h3>
    <p>Most websites evaporate due to one factor: domain name registration costs money. An unused asset eventually can&apos;t be justified and returns to the market. </p>
    <p>I&apos;ve owned this site for over a decade and used it mostly for private notes and experiments. I do stuff in public now and modified the front page to showcase it.</p>
    <p>Regularly inspired by people like <a href="https://dynomight.net?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">Dynomight</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">Taylor Troesh</a> who pump out great writing.</p>
    <h3>Weight lifting</h3>
    <p>I lifted 113 times this year but many weren&apos;t systematically progressive. By November I gave up the goal.</p>
    <p>It got really boring. Boring sucks.  Many of the lifts were simply "greasing the groove" and not focused on getting to failure.</p>
    <p>I&apos;m not blind to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes" target="_blank">"sour grapes"-thinking</a> though. I failed.</p>
    <p>Better measurement this year, changes to keep it fun and reach the "finish line" before October/November.</p>
    <h3>Daily logs of side-project</h3>
    <p>I set out to re-write <a href="https://24HourHomepage.com?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">24HourHomepage.com</a> so anyone could publish on it for free. I did by chipping away at the work every morning before work. That work finished in March. Once development was done, I stopped recording my daily progress.</p>
    <p>This was not a specific goal. No bueno.</p>
    <p>How could it have gone better? Ask myself more proding questions: what do I do when dev work is done? what does a marketing rhythm look like?</p>
    <h3>Confidently climb V4 holds</h3>
    <p>My wife and I started climbing more regularly toward the end of 2022 and thought it would be fun to do this together. We had a decent rhythm of going twice per week for half the year but my climbs weren&apos;t focused on V4 but rather fun.</p>
    <p>A win-win though: more fun time with my wife.</p>
    <h3>Early bird</h3>
    <p>Creative and operational freedom is important to me. Waking up early every weekday gives me a reliable 10hours per week to work on something I can grow into a healthy community or business.</p>
    <p>Like my logging goal, I met this goal so long as I was writing code. Once that was done, I stopped waking up early. I can do better.</p>
    <h2>Next year</h2>
    <p>This year, I have fun goals. More running, more writing, a fun DTC product, and being more present.</p>
    <p>If you have a resolution, I&apos;ll <a href="/yearlydollargoals" target="_blank">give you $1</a> if you finish it in 2024. ✌️</p>

    <h1>Public accountability and Privatization <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="eyes" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f440.png">üëÄ</g-emoji></h1>
<blockquote><strong>tl;dr: </strong>I keep a public daily log of what I plan to accomplish. I summarize
the day's events before I go to sleep. This includes some basic details of my life but also some details that should be kept
private. I wrote a tool (<a href="https://github.com/higgins/privatize"><code>privatize</code></a>) to automatically encrypt/decrypt private information in my log.</blockquote>
<h2>Background: Why?</h2>
<p>One of my goals this year is to commit to a daily journal practice and share that
log publicly. Why publicly?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'd like to have an easily digestible artifact for friends and
family. A crude artifact, yes, but sometimes I think how nice it'd
be to have some glimpse of a "day in the life" of one of my
ancestors. <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="cheese" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f9c0.png">üßÄ</g-emoji></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The log is meditative. I understand that not everything is in my
control but I can control how I respond to everything. Having a system
where I regularly review my life is invaluable to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public accountability systems work for me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem: not everything public should be public</h2>
<p>Some other engineers and I have been building a mobile entertainment
app in "stealth" mode. Until we're ready to invite people in, we
shouldn't share some of our work.</p>
<p>In the flow of writing, I don't want to censor my thoughts. If it's
helpful to describe the steps I took tackling a problem, I'm going to
write them out and potentially share some private information. That's
a no-no.</p>
<h2>Solution: <a href="https://github.com/higgins/privatize">privatize</a> ‚Äî partial file encryption/decryption</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/higgins/privatize"><code>privatize</code></a> is a tool to <em>partially</em> encrypt/decrypt the
contents of a file.</p>
<p>When added to a git repository, it will do this encryption/decryption
automatically.</p>
<p>It works much the same way that <a href="https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt"><code>git-crypt</code></a> does but instead of
encrypting the entire file, it parses that file for any text wrapped
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document">heredoc</a> <code>&lt;&lt;PRIVATE</code>/<code>PRIVATE</code> and encrypts/decrypts that.</p>
<p>For example, the following file contents:</p>
<pre class="codeBlock"><code># example.txt

Today I a burrito. üåØ
&lt;&lt;PRIVATE
I was on the toilet for hours.
PRIVATE
I got a lot of reading done.
</code></pre>
<p>when <code>privatize</code>'d would be:</p>
<pre class="codeBlock"><code># example.txt

Today I a burrito. üåØ
&lt;&lt;PRIVATE
xuJ0fld2vmNWaVLogTIufmWsiFso
PRIVATE
I got a lot of reading done.
</code></pre>
<p>The public text is still legible, but any text I marked as private is
encrypted with my symmetric key.</p>
<p>MacOS users can download it here:</p>
<pre class="codeBlock"><code>brew tap higgins/privatize
brew install privatize
</code></pre>

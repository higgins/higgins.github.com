# 24hourhomepage — Week 6 — Three questions I ask before engaging

**tl;dr:** Last week I reached out to 70+ marketers at brands with a history of creative advertising. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, so I ask 3 questions before reaching out.

# # Overview

Last week—in my effort to make the most creative, collaborative internet art project at [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) and get better at sales and marketing along the way—I dove head first into LinkedIn messaging tools. I’m on the trial program of LinkedIn premium and I gotta say: it’s a tool designed for research more than outreach.

Here are 3 questions I ask before reaching out to a brand:

1.  Will it last?
2.  Are they creative?
3.  Will they love it?

## # Will it last?

24h<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">o</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>urhomepage.com will be a site people visit for years to come. If a brand brand or business doesn’t expect to be around in 30+ years, we probably aren’t a good fit for each other.

## # Are they creative?

Has this brand done any creative advertising in the past? Any commercials, events, promotions, partnerships that have lived with you after experiencing?

## # Will they love it?

Put another way: is their audience inclined to feel stronger or better about the brand after a serendipitous interaction with an advertisement?

I need three strong “yes” answers before reaching out. Thanks for the idea, [Joe Pera.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSTixeqrkIw)

## # A note from a professional

As one professional marketer I spoke with noted: We do so much to avoid being advertised to in places we DON’T expect—ad blockers, GDPR—there is some value in having the viewer go to the ad.

I agree! One of the many reasons I’m still at it!

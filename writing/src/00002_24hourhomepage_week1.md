# # Overview:

Using google sheets and elbow grease, I made my first online sales of [24hourhomepage.com](http://24hourhomepage.com/) ever last week. Nice.

I prospected and emailed **293 people**. **252** of them opened and a number of those led to sales. Of those who reply, many say how [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) is a great piece of creative advertising (even if they don’t publish).

I figured this email outreach would be the primary driver of my **627 page visits** (**360 unique visitors**) but most appear to have come from [indiehackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/higgins) where I’ve been making updates on my progress. 📈

Not too shabby for someone whose network writes are statistically: `git push`

## # Cold Outreach 🥶

Don’t be afraid. If you know what you’re offering and to the best of your ability think others could benefit from it, reach out. Most people are supportive even if they don’t buy.

## # Health 😴🥗🏋️

Leche waits for our regular stretch break walks. I wonder who enjoys them more?

Sleep: good.

Diet: good.

Exercise: goooood.

Long sessions sitting down are easier with regular breaks. Good for you, good for your friends. 🐶

## # Discoveries of 24hourhomepage 🔍

One of the best things about growing [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) is discovering new people and their products. There are so may innovators out there. Here are two who recently published ads on the site:

- [**TidByt**](http://tidbyt.com/) — A hackable display you can control with your phone and your own code.
- [**FamMail**](https://fammail.co/) — Have your favorite Instagram photos printed on high quality paper and mailed to you for $1/photo.

Can you guess what times they published? 🤔⏰

# # Learnings 🧠

1\. All of my sales had one thing in common: I **demonstrated value** and **made a discounted offer**.

2\. **Prospect in sessions.** Prospecting takes tight focus. Content and products being sold are so creative it’s like you’re battling an attention-seeking meme-haired Medusa.

To qualify a prospect, consider the following:
- Did they offer their email?
- Are they selling something online?
- Does this person expect to have a web presence long in the future?

3\. The more I talk about the site, the more people visit! What site? This site >>> [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) <<<

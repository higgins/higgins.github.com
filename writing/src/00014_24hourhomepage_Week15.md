> **tl;dr:** Last week I started reaching out to 25 podcasts. Three have gotten back to me for an initial chat and another one is already published! I’m doing a Podcast Blitz after my talk at js.la is posted. Finally, I wanted to demonstrate how expressive 1FPS gifs can be in telling a story so I made a meme website: [isthisamatrix.com](https://isthisamatrix.com)

# # Overview:

Last week — in my effort to make the best 24-hour “movie” on the internet and get better at sales and marketing along the way — I reached out to podcasts and created a meme making site to demonstrate 1FPS story telling.

# # More podcast interviews!

Of the 125+ podcasts I’ve found that might be interested in hearing about [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com), I reached out to 25 this week. Why so few? I think my message will be stronger if I can refer them to my recent talk at [JS.LA](https://js.la). Unfortunately, that won’t be published until 2 weeks from now.

But it<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"> <span id="rmm"></span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>won’t stop progress! Three have gotten back to me for a pre-interview chat and last Friday I sat down for a “micro-podcast” chat with [Simon](https://twitter.com/codeswaps) who heads up [CodeSwaps](https://codeswaps.com/).

# # Is this a Matrix 🦋?

Since I won’t be doing my “Podcast Blitz” for another two weeks, I decided to work on a creative gif tool to demonstrate that 1-frame-per-second gifs can be inventive and fun:

[http://isthisamatrix.com/](http://isthisamatrix.com/)

A simple site where you can assemble up to 60 images from the 1999 masterpiece The Matrix into whatever narrative you want.

I had the idea of compressing an entire movie down to 60 individual images played at 1FPS and 1 minute of run time. Sort of like [HitClips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitClips) from the 90s.

So I set out to compress The Matrix into 1-minute gif. I think I did an alright job.

We’re going to a wedding this weekend so I wanted to do work that could lead to more async and slow growth (hence [isthisamatrix.com](https://isthisamatrix.com)).

Try creating your own “alternative Matrix” stories!

# This week:

Along with a few direct emails, I’ll be using [https://justreachout.io/](https://justreachout.io/) to chat with journalists and bloggers.

# How you can help:

Question for you: What movie do you consider a masterpiece?

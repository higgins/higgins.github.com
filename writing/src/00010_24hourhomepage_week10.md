# 24hourhomepage.com — Week 10 — Ads that leverage the medium

> **tl;dr:** Last week I focused on getting more creative and engaging content on the site. Two features of the site led to two interesting advertisements.

# # Overview

Last week — in my effort to make [the best 24 hour “gif” on the internet](https://24hourhomepage.com) and get better at sales and marketing along the way — I focused my outreach on adding more creative content to the site. As a result, two clever ads that exploit the medium were added.

[24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) is a “time” time-capsule. Publishers “own” the second they buy in perpetuity but they also cannot change their ad once published.

They are then forced to ask themselves:

> What am I doing that is timeless?

That question opened<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"> <span id="rmm"></span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>a number of doors. It also saves time on advertisements that are better suited for other channels. Eg: If you don’t plan to be online for the next 10+ years, we’re probably not a good fit!

# # Creative Ad 1 — Salutem 😷

[Salutem](https://salutemcorp.com) is a health company. Their first product is a patent pending COVID-19 (and other viruses) killing face mask via a graphene-silver technology. An excellent product for the times.

When they expressed interest, I asked them: **“If Salutem were on a billboard seen every day for 100+ years, what would the ad say?”**

Well, for one, they’d want to show the mask. That’s what they’re selling. But as a health company, they can highlight that they helped fight a global pandemic.

Check out their ad in this week’s discoveries below and let me know how timeless it is.

# # Creative Ad 2 — Like I Am Five 🖐

[Like I Am Five](https://www.likeiamfive.com) is a learning company from [Matt Blank](https://twitter.com/CodeWithMatt). Right now, you’ll learn programming skills you can apply to your own work in under 4 hours. Great idea and as a budding entrepreneur I’m massively impressed seeing he’s grown to 700+ students.

Understanding that if he was to run the company for 10+ years it might evolve into other domains, I pitched him a meme. The idea was simple: if you can click an ad, you can learn how to code. See the meme I pitched him below!

# 24hourhomepage.com — Week 3 —Growth and feedback

> **tl;dr**: More sales and published content this week after making A LOT more gifs for prospects. I reached out to several communities of reddit and got some great feedback. I’m still creating **100 gifs for interesting products/projects**. If you know of a project/product you’d like more people to know about let me know!

# # Overview

[Last week](/24hourhomepage-com-week-2-100-ads-for-you-4e69ba5aad13) — week #3 in my journey to become better at selling and marketing my work via [24hourhomepage.com](http://24hourhomepage.com) — I started my “[100 free ads](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/100-free-ads-for-100-products-c73160ad33)” campaign for interesting projects/products I’ve discovered. I’m no where near my 100 mark, but it’s great to be exposed to so many great businesses out there.

One person even wanted to hire me to create more ads for them!

## # Reddit posts

I posted the project on several bus<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>ness-oriented subreddits. One soft metric I’ve been concerned with is “the 5-second rule” which roughly says, the value proposition should be understood by a first time visitor of the site in under 5-seconds.

Asking the folks of [/r/growmybusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/m36u18/do_you_think_my_site_meets_the_5_second_rule/), it’s clear that I don’t pass the 5-second test but as one user pointed out, it’s not a great metric to begin with. [/u/RedditBizHelper](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditBizHelper/) suggested the “5-second rule” is too soft a metric and that I should refine my focus to show how advertisers benefit and how visitors benefit.

I’ll be updating the designs for the first-time-user-experience to make these benefits more apparent. Cheers, [/u/RedditBizHelper](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditBizHelper/)!

Also, thanks to [/u/Fen94](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fen94/) for letting me know of the — now fixed — rendering issue on iPad. Kudos!

## # Feedback

Based on the great feedback I had been receiving, I set up a testimonial page to get user feedback after they’ve gone through the full product experience. I’ll be sharing those results publicly once I get enough to display a “Wall of Love”.

## # Swing for the fences

Lastly, I swung for the fences in a few cold emails/tweets offering an ad to hotshot entrepreneurs. No interest from them…YET!

# # Special shout out to Guan Jie Fung

I met [Guan Jie](https://guanjiefung.com/) on a [focusmate](http://focusmate.com/) call while prospecting. Not only did he give me some constructive feedback, he sent me a 5 minute video reviewing some “blind spots” to the user experience of [24hourhomepage.com](http://24hourhomepage.com). He runs a copy writing agency and I’d highly recommend his services.

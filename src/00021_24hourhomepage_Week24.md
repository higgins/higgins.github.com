# # Overview

I’ve been quiet since the Product Hunt launch. Really quiet. Almost entirely off the social internet. Why? Because I had to put all my energy into focusing on securing a new job. A long process but I’m happy happy to announce I’m joining a GREAT consumer product…but can’t say much more than that until we launch.

Rest assured, I’m still growing [24HourHomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com) into the most creative online art project ever and will provide regular updates here.

Onward! 🚀

# # Podcast interview 🎙

I had the great pleasu<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">r</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>e of being a guest on another podcast: [_Be Who You Want To Be_hosted by Kandas Rodarte](https://momgeek.com/89-justin-higgins/). If you haven’t seen/heard it, you should check it out!

We talked about the origins of 24HourHomepage, different use-cases for it and what I’ve learned so far.

Kandas is a positive, enjoyable person to talk with you’ll surely get something out of her discussions on entrepreneurship.

Check out our episode here!

# # Quoka interview 🔍

Miriam Dorsett was an amazing Product Hunter for the launch there last month. She founded and heads up QUOKA an entrepreneur’s mental health messaging app.

We went over a load of mental health questions as it relates to 24HourHomepage and my entrepreneurial journey.

# # Product Change: 3 seconds minimum

A quick note: some folks have called out that 1 second seems too fast to properly tell a fun story. There’s only one way to find out, change the minimum story size! This change take affect as of Sept 13th.

# # This week

I start the new job this week so that will be much of my focus. I will reach out to directly to more affiliates and artists to get their involvement in the product.

# # How you can help 👏👏👏

**Question for you:** When was the last time you stopped the train to momentarily shift focus?

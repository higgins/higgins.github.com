# # Overview 🌎

Last week, In my effort to make the Internet’s best 24-hour “movie” and get better at sales & marketing along the way — I shipped a simple Browser Extension which sets your browser homepage and new tab location to [24HourHomepage.com](https://24HourHomepage.com). A prospective customer a few weeks ago was interested in “homepage set” metrics and while that’s impossible to track this gets a little closer to that.

I finalized the assets for the Product Hunt launch this Sunday August 1st and in preparation for that, launched the affiliate sales program. 🚀

# # Chrome Extension 💻

I’ve never written a Chrome Extension before, but they aren’t that complicated. A `manifest.json` is required and captures lots of intent of the package: what’s it called, version number, user permissions it needs, icons it uses, scripts it runs. All well encapsulated and easy to understand.

For our purposes, the extension does two things:

*   Sets the browser homepage to [https://24HourHomepage.com](https://24HourHomepage.com) (via the `chrome_settings_override` property
*   Replaces the new tab location with [https://24HourHomepage.com](https://24HourHomepage.com) if and only if that location was the `chrome://newtab` state. Any other new tab condition (eg: explicitly clicking a link that opens a new tab) does not get overwritten.

You can check out the source code here[https://github.com/higgins/24hourhomepage-extension](https://github.com/higgins/24hourhomepage-extension)

# # Giving away $24,705 💸

I want to put my best foot forward with the PH launch and that means incentivize as many people to share [24HourHomepage.com](https://24HourHomepage.com) as I can.

So anyone who refers a customer to the site will get **90% commission.**

EG: Customer buys 10 seconds at $10/s, you get **$90.**

I’m running this experiment until 1 hour of the day is sold. Right now, there are 2,745 left before that mark. That means I’m giving away $24,705…let that sink in.

You can sign up here!

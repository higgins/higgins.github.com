I’m pleased…you might even say I’m **_over the moon_**…to announce my favorite music / art / creativity product has joined [24hourhomepage](https://24hourhomepage.com): [Vinyl Moon](http://vinylmoon.co/)!

[Vinyl Moon](https://vinylmoon.co) is a monthly “mixtape” vinyl club. Last December I got an annual subscription as a gift (❤️) and every month since I find myself anxiously waiting for the month’s new arrival.

Why do I geek out so hard over them? **They un<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">d</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>erstand their audience and medium.** Vinyl is definitely not the only way I enjoy music but its one of the more thoughtful ways. Each month they curate a dozen or so songs from around the world and collaborate with a visual artist to do the packaging. Magnets, popups, lenticular printing. These aren’t ordinary records. And every month feels better than the last.

I can blab all day about how creative they are but let’s talk about how we got connected…

# **# Background / Brainstorming**

Several weeks ago I was brainstorming creative companies/products that would be a good fit for 24hourhomepage. My thinking was, “I have a canvas for storytellers. I should get digital artists to join.”

After some digging on Twitter, Reddit, NewGrounds, DeviantArt I started to feel I was searching in communities I didn’t feel connected to. The coldest of cold sales. No good.

So I asked “What are some creative products that _I enjoy_?”

Then it hit me. Or rather, it was staring at me from our living room wall. [Vinyl Moon](http://vinylmoon.co) is ALWAYS making fun, creative and meta content. What if they joined?

# **# Chatting with Brandon**

Their CEO [Brandon Bogajewicz](https://vinylmoon.co/pages/about-us-1) agreed to chat about my vision. Like a binaural beat frequency tuned to an idea, he got it immediately. Moments into
our call he was listing feature ideas. “What if it was topic based? What if you could search?” I think my pen only captured half of them.

He also gave me an idea for a pretty genius spinoff product too. I
reassured him, my goal was to focus on growing this product first then
build any fun follow-ups. It must be pretty fun dreaming up each month’s product over there.

# **# What’s Next**

Vinyl Moon joined! I won’t spoil their content but I proposed a few ideas for how they can use 24hourhomepage to engage with their current and future listeners. Try to guess what time they joined…

# **# Special Thanks**

A big shout out to Brandon. His creativity and openness to chat with a solo entrepreneur is a gold standard in my book. Thanks, Brandon!

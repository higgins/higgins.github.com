**Hi, I’m Justin and I know nothing about sales and marketing.**

I do know a bit about software development though. I’ve been a professional software engineer for over 10 years and [helped build](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Music) [some](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/microsoft-acqui-hires-cinemagraphic-photo-app-swng/) [great products and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustle_(company)). I love it. I love the process, I love the people, I love taking an idea from mind cloud to code cloud.

I don’t love how I’ve been thinking about communicating my work.

Let me explain.

**My first time 🤓🌹**

My first dive into solo-engineering-land was for a product called Selfless. A web service for sharing resources you have. It’s a great idea but my execution and mindset were trash. I was building it with a pretty large flaw: I didn’t want to “sell” or “market” it. I was convinced a better network would grow organically and so made zero efforts outside product work and demos.

That’s no good. [That’s a trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

> _You have to do uncomfortable work._

Right now, **my uncomfortable work is sales and marketing** but I don’t want to throw away my _developer skillz™️_ to join a salesforce.

I’ve leveraged them.

I’ve built something that gives people value AND forces me to work on only sales and marketing.

**Introducing:** [**24hourhomepage.com**](https://24hourhomepage.com)

There are 24 hours in a day. That is **86,400 seconds**. That is **86,400 opportunities.**

Visitors of [24hourhomepage](https://24hourhomepage.com) will see one-advertisement-per-second corresponding to the current second of the day. Each advertisement is rendered as a square image and is clickable to link to your website, product, shop, business, article, music video, portfolio, etc.

Once all 86,400 seconds have been published the project is over and the site lives on indefinitely.

**So it’s an internet artifact?**

Yes, exactly. In many years you’ll still see the same 86,400 ads looping every day. You pay for your ad once and visitors far in the future will still have a handle to your advertisement and URL.

**So who will visit the site?**

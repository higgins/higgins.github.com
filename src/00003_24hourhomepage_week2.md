# 24hourhomepage.com — Week 2 —100 ads for you
> **tl;dr:** I’ve gotten more published content on [24hourhomepage.com](http://24hourhomepage.com) by offering an ad in my initial outreach. This week, I’m doing more of that and offering to create 100 ads for 100 products/services. Read more.

# **# Overview**:

Every 👏 day 👏 is 👏 a 👏 good 👏 day.

[Last week](/24hourhomepage-com-week-1-and-sales-won-f63474ee0154) — week #2 in my journey to become better at selling and
marketing my work via [24hourhomepage.com](http://24hourhomepage.com) — I focused on making
more personalized initial outreach.

So I started making people ads.

Lots of them.

Open your email, see an ad of your product.

If people like it, they can post it on [24hourhomepage.com](https://24hourhomepage.com/) and
reap all the benefits it brings.

If they don’t want to post<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> no biggie, they still get a gif they
can add to their social media, `<meta />` html tags, etc and promote their business.

Win-win.

The response? Overwhelmingly positive.

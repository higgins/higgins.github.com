    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p><em>"You can&apos;t learn to plough by reading books."</em></p>
    <hr />
    <p>Were you jealous of the kids who got to go on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow" target="_blank">Reading Rainbow</a>? Ditto. Inspired by <a href="https://taylor.town/books" target="_blank">taylor.town&apos;s</a> efforts, I write short reviews of what I read.</p>
    <p>Here&apos;s how these readings are graded:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★★★</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>I will definitely talk to you about it. Might re-read</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★★☆</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>I will probably make reference to it.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★☆☆</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>If it comes up in conversation. Some nuggets worth considering.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★☆☆☆</div>

          <div>I might warn you about it.</div>

      <li>
        <div class="legend">

    <h3 id="communicationbook">The Communication Book: 44 Ideas for Better Conversations Every Day</h3>
    <p>A fun primer on communication methods and styles. It&apos;s a popcorn and candy book designed to be flipped through in a quiet afternoon. Helpful for building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swipe_file" target="_blank">swipe file</a> maybe or when creatively brainstorming how to get two or more people to communicate better. </p>
    <p>Some nuggets include: </p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Ask people to standup during standup. Keeps meetings short</li>
      <li>Leaders are cheerleaders, captains of the energy/enthusiasm of the team</li>
      <li>When communication breaks down, get all parties to agree to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMgGCNKijM" target="_blank">"Cooperative Principle"</a>: Assume one person wants to be understood and another wants to understand</li>
      <li><em>“It is easier to build strong children then broken men”</em> — Frederick Douglass</li>
      <li>Every presentation is a story. All stories should focus on one idea.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actionable items:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Trade saying "no worries" for something that acknowledges that we are a team</li>
      <li>Are you where you want to be? Think about your thinking. Less "stinky thinky" as Zig Ziglar would say.</li>
      <li>When brainstorming in sensitive domains, use the subjunctive. "What feelings/objections COULD people have to this idea?" and not "What do you think of this idea?"</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZizdB0TgAVM" target="_blank">Peak-End theory</a>: people remember those two elements about narrative structures (people, events, etc). Example: If you&apos;re reading this, you&apos;re awesome and I appreciate you reading my notes! ✌️</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="dontmakemethink">Don&apos;t Make Me Think, Revisited</h3>
    <p>This was the first of several books I requested from <a href="https://careers.soundcloud.com/?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">my company</a>
    as part of our "Learning & Development" annual stipend. I&apos;ve worked
    with companies that have offered similar in the past but can&apos;t
    remember a time I used the benefit. Not this time!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I requested this book because I work on a user-facing
    web team for a product that&apos;s about as old as this first version
    of this book.</p>
    <p>Much of these lessons in this book I gleaned under the tutelage of Joan Swenson on my high school newspaper. Some of the key "nuggets" in this book are to remember:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Users skim</li>
      <li>...and will "muddle through" most design decisions</li>
      <li>Cleverness doesn&apos;t pay</li>
      <li>Do more user testing. Follow Krug&apos;s script.</li>
      <li>Delete unnecessary words</li>
      <li>Page titles should reflect the links that brought them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you know anyone thinking about "getting into" web
    development, this is a good primer but if you&apos;re already
    in the field, it reads like re-reading. The web moves fast and
    this seems pretty dated. Not much on the "hybrid" web/mobile
    development world we&apos;ve built, app deep links, i18n (apart from a11y) or notifications. </p>
    <p>Actionable items for me and my team:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Are we doing user testing? If not, follow the basic guideline in the book (once per month, 3 recorded sessions and a team debrief)</li>
      <li>Bake our lighthouse number into CI</li>
      <li>Do a "print and squint" test for each of implemented designs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="buckminsterpoet">Buckminster Fuller: Poet Of Geometry</h3>
    <p>I got this book as a house warming gift several years (and apartments) ago from my friend Sam Cloud. I skimmed it back then but picked it up again recently because I vibed with it. Apparently he catalogued so much of his life (from 1917-1983) that his notes/scrapbook would stack 270ft. Stored at Stanford now.</p>
    <p>Another notch on my notch board to revive selfless after reading him.</p>
    <p>Chuckled imagining Bucky throughout his life walking into a discussion where shapes were even remotely discussed and him saying..."I&apos;ve got just the thing".</p>
    <p>Nice rainy day book.</p>
    <h3 id="luciddreaming">Lucid Dreaming <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7311569866262170911" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>There was a period as a teen when I was obsessed with lucid dreaming. I loved (still love) Richard Linklater&apos;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life" target="_blank">Waking Life</a> which talks about it briefly. This book was enjoyable as a dream-journaling jump start mechanism. I enjoyed reflecting on awareness. Unlike my teenage years, I&apos;d like to use the practice for reflection...but still fly around.</p>
    <p>At times I&apos;d drift off while reading another one of the author&apos;s dream logs. Impressive how detailed he kept them and how many lucid dreams he&apos;s had in his life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc" target="_blank">The more you do, the less you do.</a></p>
    <h3 id="timewars">Time Wars <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7299718378648882463" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the first half. I got the book years before
    starting <a href="https://24HourHomepage.com"
    target="_blank">24HourHomepage</a> thinking I&apos;d enjoy the
    anthropology nuggets. I did. Like how the culturally accepted
    bereavement periods for widows has exponentially decayed in
    industrial nations.</p>

    <h2 id="upNext">Up Next</h2>
    <p>I&apos;d love to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSTixeqrkIw" target="_blank">Joe Pera at the Grocery Store</a> approach to my next media:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Should I read this?</li>
      <li>Will I read this?</li>
      <li>Can I afford this?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As an exercise in that spirit, here I write down <em>why</em> I think I should / will read this. For now, affording is easy: I rent from the library or ask my work to buy it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>The Creative Act: A Way of Being - Rick Rubin</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I help build a tool for artists and musicians to connect with music. I like some of Rick&apos;s productions. The meme was good. He&apos;s mentioned daoist stuff before so I suspect it&apos;ll be a lot like that. Morsels</div>

      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion - Derek Sivers</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I like analysis books
          that have atypical structure (as I&apos;ve heard this
          has). Reminded of Daniel H Pink&apos;s Drive where each chapter
          has tiered summaries in advance. Also, I enjoyed "Anything
          You Want", appreciate the /now movement and Derek in
          general.</div>

          <div class="why">Soundcloud and my projects. Maybe a gateway
          drug to other Godin. I liked a talk he gave online. Hoping
          its like Shoedog / underdog narratives.</div>

          <div class="why">I enjoy goal setting and focus. If there are any nuggets to share with my team about goal setting, I&apos;d love to extract it from reading. Seems helpful as I move onto new side-project after several conversations with Mariana.</div>

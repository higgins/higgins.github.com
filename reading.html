    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p><em>"You can't learn to plough by reading books."</em></p>
    <hr />
    <p>Were you jealous of the kids who got to go on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow" target="_blank">Reading Rainbow</a>? Ditto. Inspired by <a href="https://taylor.town/books" target="_blank">taylor.town's</a> efforts, I write short reviews of what I read.</p>
    <p>Here's how these readings are graded:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★★★</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>I will definitely talk to you about it. Might re-read</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★★☆</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>I will probably make reference to it.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★★☆☆</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>If it comes up in conversation. Some nuggets worth considering.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">
          <div>★★☆☆☆</div>
          <div>-</div>
          <div>I might warn you about it.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="legend">

    <h3 id="dontmakemethink">Don't Make Me Think, Revisited</h3>
    <p>This was the first of several books I requested from <a href="https://careers.soundcloud.com/?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">my company</a>
    as part of our "Learning & Development" annual stipend. I've worked
    with companies that have offered similar in the past but can't
    remember a time I used the benefit. Not this time!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I requested this book because I work on a user-facing
    web team for a product that's about as old as this first version
    of this book.</p>
    <p>Much of these lessons in this book I gleaned under the tutelage of Joan Swenson on my high school newspaper. Some of the key "nuggets" in this book are to remember:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Users skim</li>
      <li>...and will "muddle through" most design decisions</li>
      <li>Cleverness doesn't pay</li>
      <li>Do more user testing. Follow Krug's script.</li>
      <li>Delete unnecessary words</li>
      <li>Page titles should reflect the links that brought them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you know anyone thinking about "getting into" web
    development, this is a good primer but if you're already
    in the field, it reads like re-reading. The web moves fast and
    this seems pretty dated. Not much on the "hybrid" web/mobile
    development world we've built, app deep links, i18n (apart from a11y) or notifications. </p>
    <p>Actionable items for me and my team:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Are we doing user testing? If not, follow the basic guideline in the book (once per month, 3 recorded sessions and a team debrief)</li>
      <li>Bake our lighthouse number into CI</li>
      <li>Do a "print and squint" test for each of implemented designs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="buckminsterpoet">Buckminster Fuller: Poet Of Geometry</h3>
    <p>I got this book as a house warming gift several years (and apartments) ago from my friend Sam Cloud. I skimmed it back then but picked it up again recently because I vibed with it. Apparently he catalogued so much of his life (from 1917-1983) that his notes/scrapbook would stack 270ft. Stored at Stanford now.</p>
    <p>Another notch on my notch board to revive selfless after reading him.</p>
    <p>Chuckled imagining Bucky throughout his life walking into a discussion where shapes were even remotely discussed and him saying..."I've got just the thing".</p>
    <p>Nice rainy day book.</p>
    <h3 id="luciddreaming">Lucid Dreaming <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7311569866262170911" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>There was a period as a teen when I was obsessed with lucid dreaming. I loved (still love) Richard Linklater's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life" target="_blank">Waking Life</a> which talks about it briefly. This book was enjoyable as a dream-journaling jump start mechanism. I enjoyed reflecting on awareness. Unlike my teenage years, I'd like to use the practice for reflection...but still fly around.</p>
    <p>At times I'd drift off while reading another one of the author's dream logs. Impressive how detailed he kept them and how many lucid dreams he's had in his life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc" target="_blank">The more you do, the less you do.</a></p>
    <h3 id="timewars">Time Wars <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7299718378648882463" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the first half. I got the book years before
    starting <a href="https://24HourHomepage.com"
    target="_blank">24HourHomepage</a> thinking I'd enjoy the
    anthropology nuggets. I did. Like how the culturally accepted
    bereavement periods for widows has exponentially decayed in
    industrial nations.</p>

    <h2 id="upNext">Up Next</h2>
    <p>I'd love to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSTixeqrkIw" target="_blank">Joe Pera at the Grocery Store</a> approach to my next media:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Should I read this?</li>
      <li>Will I read this?</li>
      <li>Can I afford this?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As an exercise in that spirit, here I write down <em>why</em> I think I should / will read this. For now, affording is easy: I rent from the library or ask my work to buy it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>The Creative Act: A Way of Being - Rick Rubin</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I help build a tool for artists and musicians to connect with music. I like some of Rick's productions. The meme was good. He's mentioned daoist stuff before so I suspect it'll be a lot like that. Morsels</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion - Derek Sivers</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I like analysis books
          that have atypical structure (as I've heard this
          has). Reminded of Daniel H Pink's Drive where each chapter
          has tiered summaries in advance. Also, I enjoyed "Anything
          You Want", appreciate the /now movement and Derek in
          general.</div>

          <div><strong>This is Marketing: You Can't Be Seen Until you Learn to See - Seth Godin</strong></div>
          <div class="why">Soundcloud and my projects. Maybe a gateway
          drug to other Godin. I liked a talk he gave online. Hoping
          its like Shoedog / underdog narratives.</div>

      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">

          <div class="why">I work with a distributed team and I will be selling my side-projects harder in 2024. I also want to be better at small talk since I realize I haven't worked in large groups of strangers in a while. Practice makes perfect.</div>

          <div><strong>The ONE Thing -- Keller & Papasan</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I enjoy goal setting and focus. If there are any nuggets to share with my team about goal setting, I'd love to extract it from reading. Seems helpful as I move onto new side-project after several conversations with Mariana.</div>

    <h3 id="five-second-rule">Five Second Rule - Mel Robbins</h3>
    <p>A decent read to blast through on a plane for self hypnosis. The premise: "The moment you have an instinct to act a goal, you must 5…4…3…2…1 and physically move before your brain kills it".</p>
    <p>It was discovered (or "invented", she uses both phrases) while in a depressing funk. She didn't would snooze several times in the morning as she felt it the only thing she had control over. Until one night as she drifted off she saw a rocket launch countdown and woke up to hear herself say "5...4...3...2..1..." and got out of bed instead of snoozing.</p>
    <p>I'll use the tool more and have already started testing it with my morning workouts.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="atomic-habits">Atomic Habits - James Clear</h3>
    <p>This is a great read if you think you've got shit habits. Big surprise. If you've got decent systems or you think you need a refactor, then its a motivating read.</p>
    <p>Making your habits <strong>progressive</strong> is my big reminder here. I've gotten decent at making daily/regular effort towards some goal (finances, fitness, journaling) but since I don't have a <strong>regular review</strong> process, I can't say I've made great progress on these goals. Zero to one, yes, but now 1 to many.</p>
    <p>He also pushes the idea of "habit stacking". Take an existing habit and before/after doing it, add a new habit you'd like to do.</p>
    <p>His notes on avoiding mixing contexts is good too. Study for studying, meal table for meals, etc.</p>
    <p>Explore vs exploit: when something is working "exploit, exploit, exploit", when it isn't "explore (a new one), explore, explore".</p>
    <p><strong>Next actions:<strong>A regular (weekly and monthly) report card is in order, hitched onto a monthly finance review I already do and keep my progressive metrics dumb simple: fitness goals, journaling goals, finance goals, family goals, career goals, project goals and an integrity report.</p>

    <h3 id="hackers-painters">Hackers & Painters - Paul Graham</h3>
    <p>I scan <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> nearly every day and have enjoyed PG's essays. This book is a series of essays, I'll highlight some of my notes.</p>
    <p>Chapter 1 is on nerds and popularity...a topic nearly every nerd I know has thought about. Way to hook the audience. Suburbia as the "world's nursery" is an interesting frame. I've thought of the big fish / small pond model but don't think it describes reality well. Hypermedia guides much of our lives so the "lived experiences" of suburbanites vs city dwellers isn't huge. Access to more entertainment, sure, but that assumes willingness and ability to spend. Personally, I don't put much stock in proximity to museums, galleries, event venues but more in the natural environment.</p>
    <p>Chapter 2 describes the similarities between hackers and painters. Focus on small details. Learn by doing. Avoid corporate design by committee.</p>
    <p>Chapter 3 is on conformity and encouraging an inquisitive mindset. No idea is so overlooked as much as the taboo.</p>
    <p>Chapter 5 makes the YCombinator thesis: build something users love and make more than you spend. Also to weight the feedback given by certain users (average, superuser).</p>
    <p>Chapter 6 is his capitalism proposition: wealth can be created and can grow. He also argues that if you want to make $1M you have to endure $1M worth of "pain". Maybe a good motivator</p>
    <p>Much of the rest of the book are various arguments for treating code as a craftsperson. Inspiring, especially as I find the "corporate day to day" blinding teams from crafting execllent (not merely sufficient) solutions. Striking the balance between refactoring and feature development is more apropriate, I feel.</p>
    <p>"A painting is never finished, you just stop working on it"</p>

    <h3 id="convict-conditioning">Convict Conditioning - Paul Wade</h3>
    <p>The only fitness program I've taken "seriously" is the <a href="https://stronglifts.com" target="_blank">stronglifts 5x5 program</a>, largely due to its simplicity. It's big downside: you need equipment.</p>
    <p>This has always been the draw to calisthenics but scanning the community, it wasn't clear if there was a "no nonsense" guide to progressive training like the 5x5 program.</p>
    <p>That's the idea behind <em>Convict Conditioning</em>. Six exercises each with 10 steps to progress to the "master form" of the movement. Each step has 3 levels to progress through. My only gripe is the "handy wavy" call out that the student should be patient with the first forms of the exercise and execute them even if they have mastered it. Important to master the basic moves, I agree, but I like checking off boxes and want a basic model for how often I should execute the easier exercises. Let's say 3 times.</p>
    <p>In this spirit, I have a small app I've been meaning to build. I'll release it in 2026 or sometime late 2025</p>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed this and would recommend it to most readers with even a basic interest in science. The premise is simple: our Sun is dimming and nations of the Earth coordinate a research effort to understand and attempt to fix it before extinction.</p>
    <p>A fun "beach read" or airplane read while for your next vacation.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3 id="solaris">Solaris - Stanislaw Lem</h3>
    <p>I love the 2013 film adapation of Lem's "The Congress". So much, I figured I should finally watch Solaris (the 70s version) after reading the book. Loved it. Was hooked at the end of the first chapter.</p>
    <p>Lem drops us on a scientific outpost of an exoplanet named Solaris: a planet whos orbit around its binary star should be unstable but for some unknown reason is stable. Hence the scientific outpost. Among the many theories Earth create to account for its orbit is a wild one: the planet is sentient and can manipulate EM and possibly gravitational waves.</p>
    <p>Great concept. As the scientists test this theory, the planet responds by creating physical simulacra of people from their memories. Not hallucinations, real entities that grow their own memories. The scientists probe and the planet probes back. What a great premise.</p>
    <p>Elements of the book reminded me of that TNG episode where the extreme empath is obsessed with meeting and dying with an ancient alien entity.</p>
    <p>My only bore with the book came in one drawn out chapter with descriptions of the Solaristic science theories. Maybe it was a publisher word requirement, but I didn't find the descriptions of fake science captivating.</p>
    <p>Going to watch the movies now.</p>
    <h3 id="creativeact">The Creative Act: A Way of Being - Rick Rubin</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed this and would probably recommend it to folks who aren't in a reading itch. This being the last of my book stack, I realize I "got full" a few books ago. Started to feel an itch to build and create instead of reading about building a creating. It's sort of meditative, like running is.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the preface says to treat this like a collection of thoughts. To use what's helpful and  discard the rest. A translation of the Dau de Jing.</p>
    <p>Apart from the lettering, there is one symbol used on nearly every page but given no mention. The circled-dot: ⊙</p>
    <p>A reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy)" target="_blank">Monad</a>, I guess. Also a cool symbol for an artist reflecting on the nature of creating and creators. No mention to God or higher power, but "Nature" and ("nature") may have come up a few times.</p>

    <h3 id="howtolive">How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion - Derek Sivers</h3>
    <p>Loved this format. An afternoon read to jog some ideas when
    you're stuck in a philosophy. Who knows how much of the author is
    in these proclaimations. Its giving "unreliable narrator".</p>
    <p>No any two chapters feels directly contradictory. Part of the charm of language. Hegelian.</p>
    <p>A book to lend to for those seeking a multitude of perspective.</p>

    <h3 id="onething">The ONE Thing -- Keller & Papasan</h3>
    <p>Leverage. 250 pages reminding you to seek leverage. The mantra of the book is:</p>
    <p><em>"What is the one thing i can do (now, this week, this
    month, this year, this decade) such that by doing it, everything
    else becomes easier or unnecessary"</em></p>
    <p>Helpful when you feel uncertain of next steps. Especially
    helpful if that phrase is applied recursively. In 10 years, in 5
    years, in 1 year, in 1 month, in 1 week, today, now.</p>
    <p>Some nuggets I'm keeping in my back pocket:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li><em>"When you argue your limitations, you get to keep them"</em></li>
      <li>Don't be afraid of chaos. Focus on planning, executing and measuring.</li>
      <li>Big lies: everything on your task list matters equally</li>

    <h3 id="howtowinfriends">How To Win Friends & Influence People</h3>
    <p><em>"Open their mouth, grab a handful and throw. Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage"</em></p>
    <p>Dr Cox's advice to JD on a Tylenol prescription. Also works for a book of 30 principles on how to be a better person.</p>

    <p>Hard not to like this book. It should be a requirement that all non-fiction has a "how to use this" preface and this didn't disappoint. Here, he suggests the reader write in the margins and become an active auditor / re-auditor of the ideas he suggests.</p>

    <p>The format is simple: 30 chapters grouped in four sections. Each chapter focuses on motivating one principle related to the theme of the section. He could have called the book "30 principles to win friends and influence people" but it doesn't ring the same.</p>

    <p>Even though his anecdotes on history are fixed on success stories of the early 20th century--well, and Abraham Lincoln--the principles are timeless.</p>

    <p>For most professionals, these principles will seem...almost too simple. "Don't critize, condemn or complain", "Smile", "Appeal to nobler motives". His opening reminder to occassionally return to the book or build systems to regularly evaluate if you're following the principles, remind us to avoid hypocrisy. Practice what you preach.</p>

    <p>To that end, some nugget that stood out were these practices:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">

      <li>Keep a DGT list -- "Darn Good Things (I've done)". My retort--and I think Zig Ziglar's--to the DFT list. Regularly remind myself of some of my best moments in life.</li>

    <h3 id="thisismarketing">This is Marketing: You Can&apos;t Be Seen Until you Learn to See</h3>
    <p>Why did I choose this one? I said I hoped it was more of a Shoedog / underdog-type narrative but I was wrong. </p>
    <p>It reads like a grab bag of marketing suggestions and for the
    first third I was pretty upset with myself that I chose to read
    it. I've liked Godin's youtube talks in the past and think he's a
    skilled speaker, but after this read I'm not eager ot read
    anything new he puts out. Maybe "Purple Cow" or his earlier, more
    focused works. This felt like reading a "best of " album, designed
    by the publisher to ensure some holiday sales. I sound like a
    curgudgeon. I would recommend this to anyone who is stuck in the
    "I can create something and silently keep it to myself and hope
    it'll grow"-phase of creation. Possibly only the "smallest viable
    market" or "a better business plan" questionaires actually.</p>
    <p>Some nuggets:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Think of the smallest viable market. Initially, don't build for everyone on the planet.</li>
      <li>Consider the NRA. Only 1 Million members and they are comfortable not growing. Member churn is probably very low.</li>
      <li><a href="https://24HourHomepage.com" target="_blank">24HourHomepage</a> is a tool for <strong>brand marketing</strong>. Those obsessed with metric based advertising may not want to participate. That's okay.</li>
      <li>As tech gets easier ask: "do we have the guts?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="communicationbook">The Communication Book: 44 Ideas for Better Conversations Every Day</h3>
    <p>A fun primer on communication methods and styles. It&apos;s a popcorn and candy book designed to be flipped through in a quiet afternoon. Helpful for building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swipe_file" target="_blank">swipe file</a> maybe or when creatively brainstorming how to get two or more people to communicate better. </p>
    <p>Some nuggets include: </p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Ask people to standup during standup. Keeps meetings short</li>
      <li>Leaders are cheerleaders, captains of the energy/enthusiasm of the team</li>
      <li>When communication breaks down, get all parties to agree to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMgGCNKijM" target="_blank">"Cooperative Principle"</a>: Assume one person wants to be understood and another wants to understand</li>
      <li><em>“It is easier to build strong children then broken men”</em> — Frederick Douglass</li>
      <li>Every presentation is a story. All stories should focus on one idea.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actionable items:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Trade saying "no worries" for something that acknowledges that we are a team</li>
      <li>Are you where you want to be? Think about your thinking. Less "stinky thinky" as Zig Ziglar would say.</li>
      <li>When brainstorming in sensitive domains, use the subjunctive. "What feelings/objections COULD people have to this idea?" and not "What do you think of this idea?"</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZizdB0TgAVM" target="_blank">Peak-End theory</a>: people remember those two elements about narrative structures (people, events, etc). Example: If you&apos;re reading this, you&apos;re awesome and I appreciate you reading my notes! ✌️</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="dontmakemethink">Don&apos;t Make Me Think, Revisited</h3>
    <p>This was the first of several books I requested from <a href="https://careers.soundcloud.com/?utm_source=encapsulate.me" target="_blank">my company</a>
    as part of our "Learning & Development" annual stipend. I&apos;ve worked
    with companies that have offered similar in the past but can&apos;t
    remember a time I used the benefit. Not this time!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I requested this book because I work on a user-facing
    web team for a product that&apos;s about as old as this first version
    of this book.</p>
    <p>Much of these lessons in this book I gleaned under the tutelage of Joan Swenson on my high school newspaper. Some of the key "nuggets" in this book are to remember:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Users skim</li>
      <li>...and will "muddle through" most design decisions</li>
      <li>Cleverness doesn&apos;t pay</li>
      <li>Do more user testing. Follow Krug&apos;s script.</li>
      <li>Delete unnecessary words</li>
      <li>Page titles should reflect the links that brought them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you know anyone thinking about "getting into" web
    development, this is a good primer but if you&apos;re already
    in the field, it reads like re-reading. The web moves fast and
    this seems pretty dated. Not much on the "hybrid" web/mobile
    development world we&apos;ve built, app deep links, i18n (apart from a11y) or notifications. </p>
    <p>Actionable items for me and my team:</p>
    <ul class="review-list">
      <li>Are we doing user testing? If not, follow the basic guideline in the book (once per month, 3 recorded sessions and a team debrief)</li>
      <li>Bake our lighthouse number into CI</li>
      <li>Do a "print and squint" test for each of implemented designs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="buckminsterpoet">Buckminster Fuller: Poet Of Geometry</h3>
    <p>I got this book as a house warming gift several years (and apartments) ago from my friend Sam Cloud. I skimmed it back then but picked it up again recently because I vibed with it. Apparently he catalogued so much of his life (from 1917-1983) that his notes/scrapbook would stack 270ft. Stored at Stanford now.</p>
    <p>Another notch on my notch board to revive selfless after reading him.</p>
    <p>Chuckled imagining Bucky throughout his life walking into a discussion where shapes were even remotely discussed and him saying..."I&apos;ve got just the thing".</p>
    <p>Nice rainy day book.</p>
    <h3 id="luciddreaming">Lucid Dreaming <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7311569866262170911" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>There was a period as a teen when I was obsessed with lucid dreaming. I loved (still love) Richard Linklater&apos;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life" target="_blank">Waking Life</a> which talks about it briefly. This book was enjoyable as a dream-journaling jump start mechanism. I enjoyed reflecting on awareness. Unlike my teenage years, I&apos;d like to use the practice for reflection...but still fly around.</p>
    <p>At times I&apos;d drift off while reading another one of the author&apos;s dream logs. Impressive how detailed he kept them and how many lucid dreams he&apos;s had in his life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc" target="_blank">The more you do, the less you do.</a></p>
    <h3 id="timewars">Time Wars <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justinprojects/video/7299718378648882463" target="_blank"><img class="social" src="/assets/tiktok.svg"/></a></h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the first half. I got the book years before
    starting <a href="https://24HourHomepage.com"
    target="_blank">24HourHomepage</a> thinking I&apos;d enjoy the
    anthropology nuggets. I did. Like how the culturally accepted
    bereavement periods for widows has exponentially decayed in
    industrial nations.</p>

    <h2 id="upNext">Up Next</h2>
    <p>I&apos;d love to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSTixeqrkIw" target="_blank">Joe Pera at the Grocery Store</a> approach to my next media:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Should I read this?</li>
      <li>Will I read this?</li>
      <li>Can I afford this?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As an exercise in that spirit, here I write down <em>why</em> I think I should / will read this. For now, affording is easy: I rent from the library or ask my work to buy it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>Benjamin Franklin's autobiography</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I like anecdotes of his daily routine. Maybe his autobiography is overkill though.</div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="nextbook">
          <div><strong>Personal MBA -- Josh Kaufman</strong></div>
          <div class="why">I want to make enough money that me and the family I'm growing with my wife don't have to have a day job whose financial health and destiny isn't in our control.</div>

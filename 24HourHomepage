* Embeddable Advertising Widget
I want people to talk about 24HourHomepage online.
To do that I will incentivize them to share 24HourHomepage links.

I want an embeddable experience of 24HourHomepage on peoples site /
blog / newsletter. Any place that might render an animated gif.

A link that, when shared, resolves to a gif corresponding to the
images of that hour.

An image URL would be best. It is embeddable without javascript.

TODO:
- [ ] Calculate how big an animated gif would be if for 100x100px x 86400 seconds
100x100 px = 1e4
1e4 pixel * 24 bits / pixel * 86400 / 8 = 2.592e6B = 2.42 GB

2.42 GB is too big to share


Let's work backwards...
86400 seconds in a day
If each second was one represented by one bit, we would need 86.4Kb to store the full day

Assume 10MB file is a reasonable upper limit
10 MB = 10,000 KB = 80,000 Kb

80,000 Kb / 86400 seconds = 0.926 Kb / second

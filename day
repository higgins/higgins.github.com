** Summary

First run in a while. 7 miles at a ~11.5min/mile pace. We're watching too
much video in the house. How to set a good example for kids? TV/computer
closets? It can't be pure pleasure/bordem driven, there are so many more
fulfilling things to do.

Book reports per show?

Tomorrow is holiday. Chores and playing with Leche. Fasting.

** Summary
Rethinking how we build features on my team. Pair coding and radical
pod ownership.

* 10/28/2025
** Summary
Some ups and downs but still at it. The big stuff is made into small
stuff and serialized. Sometimes there are "all my energy"-type events
which really take a tole and are probably net negative in how I'm
executing. Possible that a more disciplined attention or 18 hours
would make these events less consuming/more manageable.

Having kids, will bring this to a head.

SoundCloud is fun. GitPushups is fun. MBC is fun and can be REALLY
fun. Life is good.

* 10/12/2025
** Summary
No updates in a month is indicative of distraction and bad habits. I
ran the Portland marathon on October 5th. My uncle ran too. I ran
30min faster than my practice time and was save by ibuprofen at
mile 22. Had I known it worked so well, I would have taken it at mile
14. Not sure how regular that should be if at all, so I want to train
my knees better. Pretty sure my form was fine for using the Xero Prio
barefoot shoes. I trained in barfoot sandals all year and walk
barefoot around the house.

Not sure when next race is but for the next 12 weeks my routine is:

- strong lift 5x5 every other day
- running 3 times per week
- at least 1 bigger run on the weekend

That takes me to the end of the year. With two weeks in TJ for the
holidays, I'll find a way to get the weight down there. Maybe
sandbags?

Cutting through noise at SC is important. To me that starts with
fundamentals:

- Engineers merge often
- Engineers merge a lot
- Engineers discover work via tickets
- EM writes detailed tickets
- PM sets product goals
- EM meets with PM to create work
- EM meets with engineers regular for goal setting and review
- PM & EM review cycles regularly
- Engineers note what is working and not working

And time box the crap out of it. At home, responsibilities are to
Mariana and our family. That includes exercising Leche which is often
simply longer (~30min) walks or some tennis ball throws. Maybe some
runs with her soon?

Day off tomorrow. I'm gonna code because work's code has been pretty
stagnant. Carving a plan for the future of web SC such that PMs and
Directors don't get scared that they'll slip on biz goals. IE gtfo
crossfade.

After the marathon flew down, rested a day, then drove down to TJ on
Wednesday night to pick up Leche. Drove back the next day. First time
in Mexico at Mariana's mom's without her. She joked not to take her
mom from her.

Osvaldo drove up this weekend for Chappel Roan concert. Fun to see him
but poor planning on my part as all house responsibilities got pushed
till Sunday evening. Much "weekender" lifestyle; not for me.

Finishing laundry, then reading 1 Samuel, then bed.

* 09/11/2025
** Summary
Busy week. Onsite for team, planned. Some good focus.

GitPushups.com is live in both app stores

Bed.

* 09/08/2025
** Summary
Ran 22miles on Sunday. Bonked at 14 but pushed through after
walking. Felt good. Terrible sleep that night though. GPU is nearly
ready, fixing a crash in the FTUX then talking about it this week.

Team dinner tonight in Venice. Good to talk about music.

Bed.

* 09/04/2025
** Summary
GPU is ready to share! Making the repo public and preparing "marketing" materials

Normal run tomorrow. Big run on Saturday. Maybe shoes again after the marathon? Maybe a harder soled earth runner shoe. 800 miles for $100 vs 2000 miles for $50 is noticeable.

Mariana is in TJ. Doing some joint gym sessions with her next week. Tempted by workout bench to put next to my standing desk. Blackfriday gift possibly

Bed

* 09/02/2025
** Summary
Drove to Emeryville this weekend to meet Luna, Jered and Jacquelines
new baby. She's great. Good eater and sleeper. We stayed at
hotel. Took Leche and kept her in hotel room for no more than 4 hours
alone. Still sucks to do that but better than alternatives and she
didn't mind the long walks as a trade. I went for 4 mile runs in the
morning, 6 mile run one day. Played tennis with Mariana at a park.

Feel burned out.

* 08/25/2025
** Summary
Last week was pretty rought work at SC. Ads experiment, Insights graph
work, launch of vinyl, e2e tests. Noisy.

Looking better now.

Went to TJ for the weekend. Wedding anniversary (50th!) for Natale y
Mema. Both dancing and laughing. Very inspiring.

This week. Goal is to get Android app live before Friday morning. Time
boxing. Tuesday night spanish hw + Android dev. Wednesday night
Android app.

Running tomorrow morning

* 08/19/2025
** Summary
Lots of talking in meetings today. Some alignment on vision of "Artist
Success" but more to come. Launched vinyl.

Work went late. After work, resubmitted iOS app. Spanish
homework. Leche walk.

Bed

* 08/17/2025
** Summary
Went for a 19mile run yesterday. With water bladder, date bar,
electrolytes during. Better energy on the last laps. Left ankle
flaired up around 16 then got better. Right toe got fractured (I
think) when I tripped on some sidewalk.

No need to go to market post run. Use what is at house. Teach this.

Chores afterward and played with Leche. iOS app is live, submitted
subscription one for review. Tomorrow night, submitting the android
one.

SC sprint planning tomorrow. Also removing Rive. Will start tracking
"Justin spike" in separate team.

Mariana is back. Figuring out schedule for Oregon trip. She wants it
one way, need to decide whats best for us.

Bed.

* 08/15/2025
** Summary
SC, design polish, Rive bye bye, TOS branch
After work, walked with Leche in neighborhood
After that, got iOS build in app store. I might need to release free version first?

Mobbin is good for browsing other great apps. Simplify the user
offering for MBC

After -- spanish class, played with Leche
GPU -- Android preview working
Polishing it tomorrow, verifying ios is good and submitting before EOW

* 08/10/2025
** Summary
Ran 16 miles on Saturday, most I've ever run. Bonked out on the last two miles though so really need to get nutrition right and endurance up before Portland.
Weight is increasing now that I'm meal prepping. It's so simple, I don't know why I didn't do this before. I think Mariana is gonna dig it too.

Mariana is with her Mom who had an emergency hospital visit. She's fine but will have some lifestyle changes to make.

Three items are on my mind for potential future purchase: 4xe before we have kids, incline bench (that is quality and moveable), Apple Watch as my "daily driver" and productivity tool. The goal would be to leave phone at home if I can

More research needed on all 3.

Did some chores that felt good. Started step zero of the garage cleanup. Office desk is open again. Dedicated printer was too much space for not using it regularly. Posting stuff on CL and donating others. Meal prepped.

Leche needs some big play time soon. Possibly after work tomorrow.

GPU app is looking great. Android build is functional (not showing image preview, but that's tomorrow's goal). Polish round by Tuesday then submit both apps to app store by Wednesday.

SoundCloud vinyl deadline coming up. Insights work looking good.

* 08/07/2025
** Summary
Started some insights work at SC. Mariana driving in TJ this
weekend. Getting GPU in app store by next week. Email loops and
marketing loops is the focus once all features are built

Running everyday is awesome. Mealprep'd meals great too

* 08/04/2025
** Summary
New training system started yesterday: everyday + one big run for
volume before big race. Training in the EarthRunners now.

Fasted on Sunday and ran the half in full sun (sunblock on
face). Fasted run this morning too (36 hours total). Made me realize I
need to start thinking about pace. My strategy so far has been: run a
little more each week until race day. I thought I was keeping an even
keel but after the half test, I went from 9min/mile pace to 11min/mile
pace.

Granted, I'll be training with more nutrition going forward and likely
with salt packs. Unclear how I'll mix in the fasted run. It felt
incredible to only have liquid (electrolyte water, mate, sparkling
water) but nutrition should be dialed in before making that a habit.

Found a better system for nutrition tracking: meal prep. The thinking
is: have enough packaged meals in the fridge for breakfast, lunch,
dinner that hit all my nutrtional needs then packaged snacks for
supplementation and extra calories. End each night with a peanut
butter sandwich since I'm still training pushups daily and weights
when I can.

Doing a deep clean of the office space and bedroom while Mariana is
away. Garage too. Then starting and finishing the android app.

Listened to Zig Ziglar and only now realize how strong SC slack is at
dividing attention. It may be time for a minimal, better slack
client. One that acts like inbox-zero of sorts. If he's interested,
will work with Islam on it but later in the year if at all.

Bed.

* 07/31/2025
** Summary
In office with Leche today. Not letting her roam without me due to the
agreed protocol. She does get pretty excitable when in the room with
me all day.

Sunflowers looking great. Apple Healthkit integration is the last pro
feature to build

Bed

* 07/29/2025
** Summary
Weekend came and went and I didn't do any real hustle. Ran 10 miles
and had some good time with Mariana. Beach and OC carnival. Gotta
practice those carnival rides more...maybe.

SC work is crazy noisy. Need org buy-in to get the architecture off
the iframe craziness we have. Less is more. Simple is good but simple
is hard.

Going for a run in the morning.

* 07/24/2025
** Summary
Office yesterday and today. Met lots of SC coworkers IRL. Eliah,
Kalisha, Ishita, Devi. Engineering is pretty silo'd it turns out.

Office again tomorrow. Appstore review cycles for hackathon project
still. Full attention means pausing on other efforts.

Incredible sleep with music recently.

* 07/21/2025
** Summary

Weekend was great. Sunflowers looking awesome but at some point in the
afternoon a squirrel (or something) broke the head on one near the
house. We harvested that one and the big one out front thinking the
squirrels would get to it too (and we didn't' want to risk it). Sap on
the sunflower head is incredibly sticky. Wonder if its used in
industrial processes.

At SC, lots of meetings including: Sprint planning, debug with Lukas,
sprint planning 2, linear chat, capstone huddle. Tomorrow, patching
prod and doing sprint work. Running in the morning.

After work, resubmitted my app to the app store after some login and
privacy policy wording rejections.

Leche in the office.

* 07/20/2025
** Summary
Exercise reset. 7 mile run. Strong Lift. The house is crazy
noisy. Television on all the time.

No caffeine by means of cold exposure is on my mind. Going to bed,
reading first.

* 07/15/2025
** Summary
Meetings. After work: IAP direct purchase isn't the way to go. Get a
free build approved, then direct purchase, then RC

Magic Castle tomorrow.

* 07/14/2025
** Summary
Have a path forward on GitPushups. Unblocked the ads team at SC. Went
for a 7 mile run after work. Ate too much protein.

Bed.

* 07/11/2025
** Summary
Golf in the morning. Was TIRED. Work from office after, before biking
home. Coffee with Teja.

* 07/09/2025
** Summary
App store still rejecting on silly things. Pretty sure its not the
same reviewer, else wouldn't get rejected for some reasons. The
subscriptions still feels like a catch 22.

Submitting for review, even though RC is still erroring.

* 07/08/2025
** Summary
Went to Catalina island for Mariana's birthday. Incredible. Unplugged
and just enjoyed the beach. Not a care in the world. Leche got to go
full dog too. Throwing a ball into the ocean wasn't her thing, but
fetching a dried up crab leg from the shore DEFINITELY was.

Bald Eagles on the campground too. How patriotic. Some wild dear
visited us. Leche got all defensive in the night. Mariana and Maru had
a blast too. Reading, sunbathing, swimming.

Took a while to get back but still worth it. Maybe every year?

Back home could have used a day to decompress but that's a mental
thing. Sunflowers in our front yard are in bloom. The first one is
HUGE and reminds me of the one my mom planted when I was a kid and
first noticed how huge they get. Dinosaur variety.

Needed an afternoon run yesterday (Monday) to reset though. Feeling
bad or unfocused? Unplug, break a sweat then get back to it.

Bed.

* 06/25/2025
** Summary
SC work deployed. At home, got more basics done on project

* 06/24/2025
** Summary
Felt like a Monday still. SC effort should flow. All software effort
really. Flowcode, not vibecode.

After work, app got approved for testflight. Getting the website
ready. It's style will be minimal, have the mannequin give lots of
product sales talk. A video somewhere too

Bed.

* 06/23/2025
** Summary
New day
* 06/22/2025
** Summary
Good day and some focused time on the app build. Went to "free swim"
hour with Mariana then Best Buy. Leche big walk in the morning and
some play in the morning.

Sharing app with friends before final polish tomorrow and Tuesday.

* 06/21/2025
** Summary
Good day. Some programming yesterday, some time with Mariana and
friends today.

* 06/19/2025
** Summary
Functional app with nativemodule, api requests. UX, more APIs and
styling tomorrow

* 06/18/2025
** Summary
Good day. Had 1 hour of coding time at SC. Meetings
otherwise. Pickleball with Mariana and coworkers. Smoothies after. GPU
after.

* 06/17/2025
** Summary
Thirty six hour fast. Felt great. Will continue.
A few more sessions for hackathon project.

Staying positive.

* 06/12/2025
** Summary
I'm due for a run. Tomorrow, taking some me time and programming.

* 06/11/2025
** Summary
SC office. Honing in on project for Angie. Didn't eat until after work
(breakfast bars)

Prototyped app for hackathon after work and dinner.

* 06/10/2025
** Summary
Also rough sleep last night. Eventually got back on track but it was
shaky. Hot.

Bed time

* 06/09/2025
** Summary
Rough sleep but managed today. Recharge today.

* 06/08/2025
** Summary
Focused weekend. Cleared lots out. Got the idea for hackathon done and
proved out the hard part. The vibe for this is great: very constrained
on time, so making sure the core UX, product design and marketing
loops are on point is the name of the game going forward.

Network effects are "somewhat" built in (though opt-in required). FOMO,
playful, wacky, tests the monetization of it.

Mariana was in TJ visiting her mom, then spent some time with her aunt
and cousin (they have a pool)

Took Leche on several walks.

Bed.

* 06/04/2025
** Summary
Almost done with the week. 24HHP polish is underway. Design and
content streamlining before worying about the marketing loops.

After that, planning out the summer. Vacations, hangout time with
Mariana, Spanish class, build and sell time. Hackathon projects
(including personal goals at SC)

Big weekend.

* 06/03/2025
** Summary
SC work deployed, reviewed big PRs. After work, biked to sharpen
knives at farmers market in Culver.

Worker makes sense, moving on to review tool. Then add other
sources. Then add new face.

Really need to timebox this project. Can't get burned out on it and
need to juggle MBC with it. The phase its in now is content rhythms.


* 06/02/2025
** Summary
Weekend flew by. In SC office today. First day for intern Angie. Back
home, fixed script but its not ready to auto-publish for me. Need
rendering mechanism and multiple sources

After that, get the basic rhythms established: X people posted on
24HHP yesterday, newsletter mechanics, etc

Then plan the week at SC and afterhours + weekend.

* 06/01/2025
** Summary
Half marathon on Saturday. Getty Museum with Moti and Andrew after. It
was for a concert but we just talked. Watched Lilo & Stitch on Friday
evening, went to beach Sunday evening. Bathed Leche when back.

I'm feeling thinking of going hard on timeblocking. 15min
chunks. There are at least 100 chunks to fit the day and 32 of those
are filled with sleep. Many tedious tasks can be systemetized. EG: No
dishes until end of day, dishes put away in morning, bed + house
tidy + leche food together?

Mini cameras in each room would be great for this. Suggest what needs
to be cleaned up based on an approximate visual diff from ideal state.

Bed.

* 05/28/2025
** Summary
In office. Then office pickleball. Then dinner, kitchen, fixed daily
script. Need to migrate.

Time blocking seems better.

* 05/27/2025
** Summary
Migrated 24HHP. Phase 2

* 05/26/2025
** Summary
Three day weekend. Mariana went camping with her boxing gym. Leche and
I hung out at the house, I migrated 24HHP. Maybe 8 hours of work in
total, even though I had 2 full days.

Saturday was a little washed because of late night on Friday and rough
start on Saturday morning.

Even so, nice to have some time for it. Feels good.

Bed.

* 05/22/2025
** Summary
End of the week. Had all hands today. No org change announcement. Need
to record product demo. Nextjs is dumb. Client component audit.

API migration almost done. SORA use should be systematic. Mock product
photography

* 05/19/2025
** Summary
Somewhat unplugged this weekend. Less regular exercise as I'm
redesigning 24HHP for a new launch. Need to declare my time
better. Only so many hours in the day. Before end of summer:

- Spanish classes start
- SC hackathon
- relaunch 24HHP with newsletter
- MBC app -- most proud version
- vacation to Berkeley
- vacation for Mariana's bday
- probably some camping or something

Plan and talk it out so it can be forecasted

Marathon in October

Making Sushi for tomorrow. Bed.


* 05/15/2025
** Summary
Sprint work done early. Awesome. PR proposals to move artists pages.

After work, prototyped new site. Migration starts soon. Minimal since assets aren't moving.
Some bigger schema changes, but KV atomic counters will be new lever and daily updates for graphs / stats.

New design will feel more professional. logo/brand will get reworked after app restructred.

Made beans for in slow cooker for dinner. Mariana went to boxing and went out for burgers with her classmates

Leche and I went on one big walk up the hill.

Bed.

* 05/14/2025
** Summary
Busy but not focused day. Have patch to demo the inline-checkout. Some
storyboarding for "Amplify". Met new PM.

Biked home. Leche ate too much then threw up outside. She's done with
pollo from TJ. Machine.

Thinking about rebrand for 24HHP if I can grow content systems.
- Newsletter of "the best things on the internet daily, weekly, monthly"
- Embed it
- Might not need rebrand with the correct systems

Tomorrow starts the migration.

Bed. Better thoughts, less caffeine

* 05/13/2025
** Summary
Woke up early to talk hackathon with Brian, pr reviews with team,
deploy tracking changes.

After work, video recorder for MBC. Ffmpeg solution tomorrow, then
migrate 24HHP and think of new growth system (embed + minimal design +
stripe connect + loops + discord?)

* 05/12/2025
** Summary
Went to TJ for Dia de Madre weekend. A rancho en Tecate/TJ border. Hot
weather but peaceful. Friday night, went to a "club" restaurant. Food
for instagram, not for nutrition or (a less requirement) taste

Inside a mall. Haven't seen too many malls in TJ. Drove back by way of
Chula Vista visit to Tia Marta's to drop off Lazarro's mirror Marcella
left accidentally in our car from the camping trip. But mostly for
Mariana to swim and hang out.

Got home around 930. Crazy hot in the house. Watered the plants after
work. Work was okay, got first draft done. Sprint planning feels
inefficient, but it could be worse.

PR effort from some team members is silly. Have plans to fix.

** Summary
Great weekend. Took a bit of a reset. Ran up and down Griffith park on
Saturday. Saw a magic show with Mariana.

Sprint work is focused. Meditation when I can. Strong lifts helped reset too.

Racoons outside last night. Sounded like they were under the floorboards or
in the attic or on the roof. No sign of them this morning.

Playing around with Sora and ChatGPT design help. Good focus.

* 05/01/2025
** Summary
RecordRTC is the way to go for dynamic rendering. Puppeteer will call
it and upload to shared location. Needs to be only canvas element, so
that's the job: make a rendering that is good enough for stories size
1080 x 1920...huge.

SC work was focused but took a while with some staging issues.

* 04/30/2025
** Summary
Better
* 04/29/2025

More "yes"
* 04/28/2025
** Summary
Reset. All time at SC is time boxed.

* 04/27/2025
** Summary
Ran half the half marathon practice hill again yesterday.

Making enough time on the weekend should be a goal because it's
exhausting starting a week feeling like all I did was scrap.

Something has to change. Gratitude is first. Grateful to be alive and
grateful to share a home with my wife and dog. Grateful we get to go
to the beach for sunset. Grateful there is a hill to climb in the
middle of the city.

Not sure what's next but bed will help. This week, the Things schedule
gets tighter.

Bed.

* 04/24/2025
** Summary
Great day yesterday until the evening call kinda zapped. Leeched into
the start of the day but fixed by the end. Great energy again

Made some peanut butter cookies and went to grocery store. Blue Oyster
mushrooms were on sale...so i bought them all.

Bed.

* 04/23/2025
** Summary
Woke up and went for a run. Took about an hour to get out the
door. Didn't think about pace or form. A few times thought about
breath. Some knee pain but not much.

Webi Arch meeting, then walked Leche, the refinement, then biked to
office. Recorded video for reddit question.

Prototyped the iap event via webview. Biked to Ralphs for curry
paste. Gave to homeless woman on second thought.

Made curry and called Mom. Bright future ahead. Possible to get in
this state of clarity and focus from breathing?

Walked with Mariana and Leche. Bed.

* 04/22/2025
** Summary
M-W are stacked days. 6 of 8 hours is back to back meetings. This is
not good work. Design by committee. Musical chairs of sorts.

"Pods" is, "hey, we trust you go do make this better"

Leafy greens tomorrow. WFoffice

* 04/21/2025
** Summary

Restful weekend. Ran the half marathon on Sunday for practice. Read
some. Kinda unplugged...and by that I mean watched movies with
Mariana. We binge watched "Black Mirror" and ate sushi.

Running needs some practice with form. Hips are tight. Flow state,
yes, but strain? That seems unconscious. If there is pain, can it be
overcome without injury.

Talked with Don today. Manager time vs Developer time will be focus
in months.

Friday shipped out MBC orders.

"Real Gs move in silence, like lasagna"

* 04/17/2025
** Summary
Six hours of back to back meetings. What a day. Made MBC orders for
shipping tomorrow. Cooked soup for dinner and fish for Mariana.

Bed.

* 04/16/2025

There's very little time to do "IC" stuff while doing as much planning
as we do at SC. Three orders of MBC to fulfill tomorrow. Will make video

Fasted for most of the days.

Deleted TikTok from phone until I get artist page up for MBC. Waking up early or doing it after work.

Prioritize it and it'll get done. Too easy to fall into TikTok traps.

Tomorrow, continuing sprint work. Deploying. Planning with Jenn. Post interview review.

Gave myself a mullet.

Spent Thursday night through Sunday in Oregon. Drove down from Portland
to Sublimity at noon on Friday, surprised Dad for his birthday. Family
looks healthy and in good direction. Tried seeing Mom but she wasn't home;
talked to her today though.

Leafy greens. Keep my blood sugar stable. Maybe it's four cups of kale per day?

Taxes after SC work. SC work was a simple feature. Made soup (barley mushroom)
from dehydrated kit. Good enough I ordered more online (some for camping trip,
some for home).

Leche is more lethargic after her trip to Mexico with Mariana.

Hitting the hay early to get some corrective sleep.

What a fun day. Debuged/pair coded with coworkers, made the argument
against tabular representation in UI, packed bag, went to airport,
cleaned code on plane, landed and realized I booked the wrong day for
rental car...oops!

Found cheap (thankfully) hotel after no-answer from Mom. Picking up
car from airport tomorrow then going to Sublimity. Coded some more at
the hotel.

Sketchy vibes at the hotel that's for sure. Huge room the lady gave
me. Seems clean enough. Vending machines weren't worth the trouble
given the strange looks I got from the perma-residents in the building.

Got water though and fought the urge for Taco Bell delivery.

Got the error message PR up. Focus.
Went to work but came back because I forgot Mariana needed the car! Oops.

* 03/25/2025
** Summary
Meetings in AM. Ran after work. Productive cough. Deployed patch for
webview testing. Deploys taking too long. What is slowest part and how
can we fix it?

Short vacation soon.

Tacos for dinner. Laptop coding sitting on couch feels nice, been a
while. Maybe laptop returns one day. Dang it apple.

Bed.

* 03/24/2025
** Summary
Feel better after fasting. Good sleep too. Feels like if I'm not
exercising regularly carbohydrates affect me more. Not very
scientific. Gut feeling.

Went to SC office today. Brought Leche. Lots of interns
applying. Shipped last summer's internship project.

Sent a "why not sign up" email, will reword for the template

Still lots of scattered, distracted energy. Focus it.

* 03/23/2025
** Summary
Was sick this weekend. Watched The Matrix on Friday and started "Paradise" show which Mariana finished. Did not eat smart on either day so fasted today. Direct energy.
Chores today, mostly small stuff. No exercise this weekend while recovering. Huge blisters on feet from Friday pickleball with coworkers.

Caught a bug. Nasal drip today and felt it behind my eyes. Thinking of
design and music sharing future.

Went to office. Refined, ios ticket, picked up water during lunch, ios
PR. Home, confirmed MBC e2e. Quick video.

More tomorrow.

* 03/18/2025
** Summary
Needed a bit of a reset there. Didn't see how fixated I was on
non-problem.

Thinking about TikTok strategy to get more artists. Each buy page can
have a video demo too.

Did some benchpress after SC work. Made a veggie pasta.

Ready for marketing.

Bed.

* 03/17/2025
** Summary
Start of sprints are usually noisy. Our release process is notably
worse now with this "shephard every PR to prod" on merge. Consumes
lots of time/attention. Work for work's sake at least until we trust
each other not to break prod?

ios pair coding with Kristen later.

Found workaround for MBC create content. Testing it tonight before
bed.

* 03/16/2025
** Summary

Went to SB yesterday. Little Lazarro is an explorer. Loves to run and
express himself. Great backyard they have. Walked Leche to the beach
and recorded video for Dad. Saw these blue things (she ate few) on the
sand. Turns out they were carniverous Velella, a non-locomotive
hydrozoa that often wash ashore. Awesome.

These new shoes are cutting into my left toe. It got inflamed. I
loosed the strap so hopefully that will help. Seedlings I planted are
starting to break soil. Very exciting.

MBC has a cookie bug I need to fix. Then I'll share the system more
widely.

Bed.

* 03/13/2025
** Summary
Took that test. Not hard like I thought, but challenging to go against
a clock. Great test. We should have a club like this at SC.

Sprint work done. Finished Refactoring reading. Work half marathon and
a bunch of great future planning meetings tomorrow.

Bed.

* 03/12/2025
** Summary
Ready. After tomorrow a different phase of focus.

Went to SC office today. Modal, conditional, rive, talk in the AM,
hiring chat with prospect, summer intern application. Vision.

I'd like to spend one friday hacking on a "ground up" build. Not an
entire change obviously. Still use same arch decisions (next, mui),
but see how fast to build with "agentic" tools. Page by page assuming
the data APIs are stubbed.

That's a dream. Ahead of that, better to audit every page we have to
understand what is "soundcloud.com".

Chat with Tommy about our systems. Get it over the line or its not a
web priority.

We'll see how this "interceptor" responsibilty of on-call shakes
out. Not a strong attendance on the call today so some education needs
to happen. The big thing is: people should feel empowered to interrupt
any threadpull and say "who is on-call? why am i not speaking to
them?". The goal being to preserve team focus.

In addition, having regular talks with comms.

Anyway. Tomorrow. Ready.

* 03/11/2025
** Summary
Rained today. Haven't been walking on treadmill. That helps. Dumb
dinner of just noodles. Lunch was rice and beans and salad. Felt
great. Dinner felt like a sugar high and crash. Stupid meal becaust
I'm not thinking of the the immediate future. More fiber

Some simple talk tomorrow proposing the new "on-call" responsibility.
Get to a place where we developers get to develop.

Mailed two MBC orders in the morning.

Bed.

* 03/10/2025
** Summary
Mostly meetings today. Two sales on MBC in the morning when Matthew
announced the drop. Pretty smooth. The checkout experience should be
enriched: allow them to buy multiple, show "you might also like".

Merged the tracking issue.

Reading in bed.

* 03/09/2025
** Summary
Finished merch drop MBC. Shinyness to be added on joining and on
creation of merch.

Ran 7miles. Ate like a moron. Hot cacao for bfast, vegan cookie later
with oatmilk matcha then flat bread with avocado dip. Stomach demons
were driving. Fasted until sundown. Ate salad then popcorn. Watched
TNG with Mariana.

Bed.

* 03/08/2025

Week is done. Writing the MBC stripe connect interface tomorrow and
practicing code

Good day. Busy but good. Raining kept us inside. Was on a call and
missed Mariana's laptop return delivery. No biggie. Talked with Tim after
work about my product. Tomorrow evening I'm gonna start the user ingestion
APIs and clients. Tomorrow at SC I'll write that Modal if I'm still in a
holding pattern for tracking.

Yesterday was our anniversary and we went to Republique for dinner. I
haven't eaten that much in a long time.

Potted plum tree as gift.

Monday. Worked from office for EAW. Meetings and demo of ios
embed. Bigger companies vs startups.

Leetcode practice is something I should do everyday like
duolingo. Rather, both language learning and leetcode practice are
good to staying sharp. Anki for both.

Tomorrow is anniversary. Bed

* 03/02/2025
** Summary
Went for a great run on Friday morning, set the energy for the day
right. If meditation can get to this state, I want that. Had big talk
about audio sensitivity which was also a proxy for creating a house
with healthy energy in it for the future. Need common ground. There's
one.

Went to Venice to busk for a few hours. One handshake deal and a
comedy club prospect. VDGN said no. Leetcode again for prep. Lock in.

Anniversary on Tuesday. Fancy restaurant Mariana picked out near her
work.

** Summary
Praying for some good rest tonight. Running makes me feel great but
a pain in my neck has returned. Stretching it out will help, takes time to heal.

That pain kicks up from sleeping on my back with straight neck.
It feels like more natural posture but if it causes this much pain, slower
correction is needed. Or just push through.

Short run after work. Work feels massively distracted, largely because
slack is a terrible place for attention. Source code is much better.

More pair coding is needed to get the team flowing.

All hands tomorrow


* 02/25/2025
** Summary
I fell off a rhythm of updates here. I don't want to blame the tools,
but it has taken some "getting used to" with my new setup. iPad
keyboard is great, but I find the MBP context and flexibility of
moving around the house to be better. That is, at least, when I'm in
"sitting mode". Treadmill standing desk still works great.

Some infra hiccups but stable now. Future looks bright.

MBC emails are still underway but I have to remember: the name of the
game is volume. I should have over 1K emails enqueued before March.

Chat with Dad today. Audio was pretty choppy but didn't matter.

Mariana started new role today and we're both pumped for her. Same
commute basically, but sounds like a much better team. The more I work
with other people, the more I care about that being a central measure.

Ran 4 miles after work. Another short run in the morning.

Bed.

* 02/18/2025
** Summary
Day back from holiday. Meetings and two SC interviews. No code.
Ran 7 miles after work, felt great. Juices flowing. Juice becomes
sauce. Come down after eating. Heavy food brings down. Four oranges
then white bean, kale onion soup. Delicious, belly full and sleepy.

Began the day continuing reading "Hell yeah or no" by Sivers. Not a
fan of the title but good pop business read like the others.

Started another campaign for MBC. I can taste success.

Bed.

* 02/17/2025
** Summary
Weekend better after today. Barefoot walking and beach time.
Swinging on rings. Mariana skated at Venice.

Saturday had some frustrations but cleared eventually. Took about
48 hours to resolve and with the big calming day of beach. Prayer
and fasting helped. Don't eat when arguing. Mindless.

Watched "Nine Days" and "The Last Stop in Yuma County"

Started email campaign.

Rain in LA. Good for LA. Bad for running. Run rain gear? Maybe after
the portland marathon. Feels good bro.

Bed.

* 02/05/2025
** Summary
Wow, a week since I've journaled. What's happened? Big brain dump:
MBC samples to two shops, Mariana flew back, considering two offers,
rain in LA keeps us inside and sedentary, mood kinda low, fasting will
help but I haven't done it, SC work is noisy as heck, Linear move is
suspect if Doreen doesn't see benefit (but she doesn't experience
pain points), she hasn't replied to a message of mine in a over a year,
rude, micromanagement from tommy on webview stuff adds to impression
that we don't trust our processes (because they are ill defined or broken),
dev env broken and bottlenecked, some interview on Saturday for MBC,
recruiters hitting me up about jobs. Best to have a pronoia state of mind.

Meditation.

** Summary
Full day for SC. Solving problems, yes. Ethos needs focus. Some hope
with adjusting how we track work. Managers want every commit to be linked
to planned work. Engineers want problems to solve from a priority queue.

We can account for that work, but no current account for "hey management
wants XYZ". At least no system for that yet. Those tasks aren't estimated
and sprint work isn't pushed, we draw straws. We're better than this.

Bed.

* 01/27/2025
** Summary
Did a lot this weekend. Pitched vendors personalized item. Will try
contacting again and dropping off this weekend.

Rained all wekend too, so easy to stay inside and get stuff done.

Right thinking: action.

* 01/25/2025
** Summary
Lots of chores today. Stayed up too late and didn't finish MBC designs
until early afternoon. Started to rain. Nice. Runs now that air is better.

Not growing the beard out just yet.

Liking the free crocs from SC as inside shoes. Maybe especially because it's
rainy outside.

Tomorrow when the rain lets up, I'm moving our garden from the back to the front
While it's raining, I'll demo videos for MBC cold pitch. Possibly drive to retailers
too.

Sleeping on the floor on the floor tonight. Think it'll be good for my back.

* 01/22/2025

Went to SC office. Mostly meetings, most important was to declare our
sprint process. Tocaya at work. Twice. Nice.

Going to go extremely slowly to solve this problem. That's all I'm doing
tomorrow.

Mariana goes on vacation tomorrow.

* 01/21/2025
** Summary
Busy day. This SC feature needs my full attention as it's super hairy
with lots of trap doors. Most of today was planning though some time
spent coding. Sold our weight bench on CL. Mariana had an interview
today.

Thinking about the Bible.

* 01/20/2025
** Summary
Been a while since I've logged. Routine was thrown off during the fires,
I think because I value how it feels after a run and I have given myself
excuses to not do that.

A nice sit in the Sun today reading. Yesterday laid in the Sun for a minute
with Leche. Did a longer run with David from Santa Monica to Venice and back
kicking a ball along the shore. Gotta work on that barefoot form next time
because my calves are ROCKED today. Got better the more I used them.

Excited for Mariana's week more than mine. Some important calls and decisions.

Somewhat focused day. WFH, walked a few miles on treadmill. Crossfade
engine changes are hair, but refactoring is bit by bit.

Extended warranty for Mariana's machine. Made fried rice for dinner
again. Need to get some groceries. Also clean out the things todo
drawer, getting gnarly, unrefined.

Tomorrow for the arch meeting, I'm going to note how we should be
deleting dead branches of code after rolling out feature flags.

Bed.

* 01/13/2025
** Summary
Back at work. Stayed in LA, probably not going to TJ. Mariana's
computer is broken and she's stressed. Unreliable, expensive
machine. Bad, rushed purchase from anxiety.

The worst stuff in our lives comes from externalizing all that anxiety
and fear into a decision. The last week has felt like this with lots
of people in LA. Help people from a place of calm and stability
otherwise you're making it worse. It's okay to be quiet.

Made a pineapple fried rice. It was okay, but not great. Will try to
make one like Good Day Thai: curry, raisins, cashew, tofu, cilantro,
pineapple, yellow onion, peas. Delicious.

Tonights was good because of vegan bouillon cube.

Been chipping away at this calisthenics recorder. Spent more time on
this new architecture (all hono 4) than I would have using the MBC
architecture. All good, it works now.

Still masks on while outside. Not a focused day. I feel great and
focused after a workout (like a run) but can't do that now. Developing
that muscle (noticing when fatigued, taking time to center) is good.

Some code to test hono + component library. Lots of false starts.

I think hono 4 + pico css is the way to go. Will test tomorrow.

Picked up Mariana from LAX, went to Benny's tacos for dinner.

We donate stuff tomorrow.

** Summary
Strong fires in LA. Air quality is poor but not hazardous where we
live. I'm wearing a face mask. We aren't in an evacuation zone but are
monitoring. If we need to, we'll leave town. We have supplies.

Not super focused today with my attention divided on the fire. Sorta
like that scene in Swordfish...except we're shipping features on a
music website.

Forcing myself to standup is helpful but I have got to get the miles
in. Lock in while standing. My lifes purpose is not to work at
sc or for any other company. Do the job then focus on our
bigger goals. Still, grateful for the work and for the product.

Rough week, everyone is remembering work processes and trying to get a
sense of priorities. Big companies with security and process, small
companies with risk, speed, creativity.

** Summary
Time flies. Back in LA after a month off. Didn't log updates. Did some
calisthenics and reading, some mental planning, reading but not very
systematic. Just doing all the things.

Some sales of MBC over the holidays. Running more. Creating simple exercise
logger which I'll use to track my progress of CC program. Before end of year
get it in others hands. Usability is key.

Big fire in Pacific Palisades. Still planning on run in Santa Monica
if the beach isn't closed.

Meditation and bed.


* 12/24/2024
** Summary
Yesterday we went to a "flyzone" an event place filled with trampolines. It was
super fun and not as hard on my body as I'd imagine. Of course, stretching helps
and what hurt would hurt even if I was younger (landing on hard surface without
giving much of the legs).

Picked up trash near the grassy area in front of Maru's place. First hour picked
up two small trash bags. Second hour + did 4 bags and completed the first part of
the island. Up to the path divider over by the bus stop. One part, where people
can hide there activities, had much more trash and filled a small bag alone.

A few dirty articles of clothing, lots of plastic wrappers, some broken bottles
but no needles, condoms or worse, so that's good.

Afte trampoline time, Mariana and I had lunch with Marcella, Omar and Lazarro
at some pasteleria place. Tasty french onion soup.

Returned home and had cupcakes Mariana made. Later we played "Mariposa" a game
about Monarch butterflies migratory patterns from and to Michoacán. Played with
Osbaldo and Mariana. We finished just in time to head out to pick up Maru's
friend Monica who flew into the airport from La Paz. We were early, so it turns
out we didn't need to rush.

Was super tired, so went straight to bed.

The day before I did a short run and calisthenics round at the park.

Today, lots of chores in preparation for the big Noche Buena dinner. Went to
Baristi first to take notes to start the day. Came home and ironed tableclothes
ironed my shirts, took Leche for a walk, went for deslactosada milk from Oxxo,
ironed another tablecloth, went for late lunch with Mariana at a newish sushi
place in Playas, went to candy store to pick up piñata candy. Mariana washed
Leche and I dried with air dryer. I took 15 min nap before dressing for party.
Washed dishes and cut some tomatoes to help Maru. Chat with Monica for an
hour or so.

Guests are coming shortly and dinner in a few hours.

Woke up for another Venice run with David. We're out there by 630 usually
and have to be back by 8 so it's a decent session. Changes it up. Filmed
some b-roll for tiktok video. Called Mom for her birthday. She's moving
out so waiting for new address to mail package to.

Watered plants and prepared for the trip to TJ. Filled tires with air,
added oil, cooked breakfast for Leche, packed clothes, cleaned kitchen.

Trips to TJ, especially the holiday ones, are much more stuffed because
we bring lots of fun stuff. Boardgames, gifts, recreational stuff. The
constraint of a plane, makes us focused. Instead, we over pack on these
trips.

Long drive. Stopped for food and atm before starting it. Leche had her bed
to sleep on but that's it. Esta bien, she was super excited to see Lazzaro
when we arrived. He was happy too. Maru made a tasty dinner of risotto,
shrimp, brocolli, etc.

Going to finish and pack the white elephant tomorrow. Then cut the tiktok
video. Will use that to nudge other vendors to get buttons of their store

This time of year, I do my end of year goals review. I'll do that early
especially since I only set one goal.

Super tired. Bed. Will work from Baristi in the morning.

Went to Venice on Saturday to sell MBC busking. Sold 13 units and got some
verbal confirmations for more. Invoice sent the next day.

Walked around Venice with Mariana.

Prototyping the vendor button jar. Side should be informative.

Need to create a sales page for vendors.

Aside: I think it's absurd to have something "playing on in the background".
Especially, garbage media. Maybe it's the norm these days. I'm sure it helps
with our increase in ADHD.

Finished cleaning the garage or as best we can without adding lots
of money, stripping off walls and resealing lots. Sold Leche's old
food container on CL. Grocery store for eggs and veggies for dinner.

Had can of beans and flat bread for breakfast. Delicious. Broke fast at
noonish.

Walked 5 miles on treadmill and did early morning tasks (monthly report,
gifts, posted on CL).

Thinking about the Bible as regular practice. Thinking how "transmutation"
was thrown around at the soundbath and how that's interpretted. "Let go and
let God" was a phrase I learned from Wayne Dyer. Thinking on that.

** Summary
Went to soundbath event hosted by Mariana's boxing friend Keo over
in Silverlake. Nice venue. Felt like a church event which felt kinda
ironic. Some statements seemed like projections. EG: I don't know anyone
who believes in God as an actual person in the sky. They also called out
how they thought God was everywhere and in all things, pointed out how
different that conception is...but that's all over most traditional
understandings anyway. Anyway, it seemed like a cheap characterization
but it wasn't compelled to object.

Had a jackfruit taco before at the venue. Went to Row DTLA for Smorgasburg
food trucks. Stupid expensive but tasty food. $18 for a lemonade. Carnival
every Sunday. Drove back to pick up Leche and post fliers for MBC sale. Took
about an hour to post all 15. Last one was posted in Commissary.

Bought TP from 711 then drove to Smart & Final for Leche chicken.

Read more of "The Power". Really want to be done with it. Maybe I finish that tomorrow.

Tomorrow, I clean the garage and do a big run.

Great day. First full day of vacation (technically I listened to
all-hands yesterday and was sorting out insurance stuff). Shipped
Evan's MBC item, transplanted monrovia plants to smaller pots, washed
car with the bucket method, updated site with pricing, got library card
(and booked study room for video), fixed toilet slamming again, squared
away insurance and most reimbursements for L&D, soup dinner, shave, cvs
to donate old meds.

Going to watch "Witness" with Mariana. Still sorting out gifts for the holidays

** Summary

Vacation starts at EOD today. Workday went late due to datadome
script needing to get deployed. All good. Still upstream issue to
workout, but good enough for handoff.

Tomorrow, taking Leche to vet in the morning then all hands at 8am.
That means I need to be back at the house by 630 so a short run.

Went to Good Day Thai for dinner and good meal overall but I put
my foot in my mouth talking about family health for a bit.

Big play time with Leche tomorrow to wake up then plan out my holiday
including and especially some good quality time with Mariana.

SC needs to get back to me about insurance, so I'll start calling HR
if no one replies.

I need to eat more greens regularly. WFPB doesn't mean crap if you don't
get a variety of slow carbs. Sugar on sugar otherwise.

Thinking about next year. If I had 10M in the bank for to grow one of my
ideas...how would I spend it?

Back at SC today. Met in morning with leads, then sprint planning
at office. Got Josh's branch up for review, going to patch tomorrow.
Another cleanup change. Confirmed multi upload change with Tim.

Home and ordered sandwich dinner with Maru from Ikes. Recognizing
I was on a content withdrawl from this weekend this evening by watching
long form YT interview. Waiting for runners "Buff" mask to show up
tomorrow for morning run. Hopefully it helps with post run sinus issues.

Going to opt Mariana in for December insurance. Tomorrow in office again
for patch deploy then taking over Kristen's work.

Leche is sleeping in Maru's room tonight.

Looking forward to personal development time this week. A few deep focus
sessions to "get in the zone" for deep work and planning. First artifcat:
MBC poster printed, website prices up, video.

** Summary
Went camping for Thanksgiving. Paradise campground in Los Padres
National Park.

I had a silent prayer on night one and on night two 11 wild turkeys
flew into our campground and stayed the night on a pine tree on our
camp site. We were campsite number 11, a favorite of ours as a child.

Had stew the first night with onion, potatoes, carrots, noodles, beans
and turkey sausage for Mariana and Maru.

Night two was green bean casserole. Night three was pesto pasta. We played
uno, read books and watched two movies ("Ad Astra" on night two and "Air"
(the Michale Jordan nike movie) on night two). Did a short hike on day three
with Mariana and Leche. Threw a football Mariana got a general store.

Drove back today and woke up to a car with dead battery. We used Maru's Jeep
because of all the stuff we packed. Biggest of which was a foldable cot she
sleeps on in the 4 person tent.

Leche slept with us in the small two person tent which really is too small
for us unless we keep things in the car. We didn't so were pretty cramped.
Either teach Leche to sleep in Maru's tent on the floor, or make more room
in our tent before bringing her. One day we'll upgrade to an 8-person tent,
but not now.

Got a jump from the camp host. Drove to SB for breakfast then to Goleta to
see Marcella, Omar and Lazzaro. Lazzaro is 30" tall now and loves to show off
his slam dunk basketball.

We drove back to LA by 230 and were home by 5 after stopping once for water.
Unpacked the car, then drove to Smart & Final for the night's groceries and
Leche's food for the week. Made dinner then took a shower and shaved. Started
laundry after and Mariana will finish once she's done with her movie.

** Summary

Went to SC office. Patched prod. Updated Josh's branch. Reviewed PRDs
Paid bills. Went to dinner with Mariana and Maru. Dropped them off for
Wicked. Went camping grocery shopping. Came home and continued Alex Grigg's
course. 50% done. Maybe more time while camping to finish.

Downloaded movies for camping trip. Maybe not enough battery for the full weekend.
Maybe enough if only using it for that...but i have lots of classes downloaded too.

Maybe the goal is to finish the "The Power" book? Maybe to plan out my time off.

I need to run before going on holiday.

** Summary
Biked to SC office. Got put on datadome work from Josh. Investigated and
proposed patch. If full deploy not in by tomorrow, I'll do a patch.

Tomorrow, will shop for camping food for trip. Mariana and Maru will see
Wicked (Maru first time).

** Summary
Back at SC. Deployed prod. Took long lunch for Mariana's stressful day.
Went to Venice for sandwhich at focassia place. Made the rest of L&D
purchases. How to not get overwhelmed with new learnings? Find a rhythm
and stick to it.

At work it's easy: pull requests. Personal development: more distracted.

- Alex Grigg's course
- Rive course
- MBC landing page
- MBC video
- MBC pricing
- MBC outreach
- Skillshare videos
- New books

** Summary
Chores today. Bought oil and added oil. Moved most plants to the front.
Posted on CL the others. Potted a few in nicer pots. Cleared out space on
the side for them and walkability. Went for water. Deposited old medicines
at CVS. Zucchini and nuts from Trader Joes. Sprouts for our food. Smart &
Final for Leche chicken. Back home. Mariana mopped the floors. I stayed
outside and read while the fumes fumed. Fire on the porch and read this
week's block of "The Power". I'll finish it on vacation I think.

Applied PaperLike to ipad. Need to finish the animation course and plan
out my self-y calendar. Must include date nights.

Bed.

* 11/23/2024
** Summary
Went for a morning run in Venice with David before going to
Glendale with Mariana for the opening of the children's library she
worked on. Not a great follow up energy from yesterday but better.

Saw Kevin, Guadi, Kevin's mom and their kid who took a liking to playing
with me. He wanted to show everyone he could open and close a door and
really liked seeing the window shades get pulled up and down.

On the way home, drove by GP's Culburn project that Mariana worked on.

Drove home, Mariana took a nap, I did chores. Watched 'Wicked' at
Culver Theater. Tickets I bought were for different theater which almost
spoiled the night. Still not great thinking about that reaction. It's a
movie. Bought extra tickets though sat apart in the theater. Emailed for
refund. Movie was long but enjoyable. More to the lore of Wizard of Oz
I'm sure. Ate popcorn for the first time this year. Not worth it. Ariana
Grande made the movie. Very funny.

Rained slightly on the way home.

** Summary
Shit evening aftern playing boardgame, but better after discussion.

* 11/21/2024
** Summary

Focus on what is important. Lots of distractions in the day, most
especially at the day job. Meetings with no resolution in sight. Meetings for
catharsis. Maybe that's necessary sometimes, create some space for others.
Often frustrating if there is no clear outcome. It gets better if you go into
a meeting knowing there must be something measurable to do afterward.

I recently heard that 1 in 100 books is worth reading. Maybe it applies to meetings
too.

Still, got plent "done" at SC today. Read a little bit more of "The Power" which
feels like a waste of time if not for Mariana reading it too. I'm going to speed
through the rest of it during Thanksgiving.

Bed.



* 11/20/2024
** Summary
Woke up for EPD town hall then arch meeting where we talked about Zeitgeist
and Mira's MUI best practices. Lots of meetings throughout the day. Deployed
to prod and patched (first to demo it for the EU team, then a real one).

Noted some changes there. At late in the day and most carbs so kinda crashed.
I think the rule is: eat some low gleisimic stuff before big carbs. Put up
patch for the v2 unfurling diff (longstanding issue).

No feature work.

Made baked potatoes for dinner. Went on longer walk with Mariana after.
Bookshelf arrived, Mariana assembled while I finished the potatoes.

Reading then bed.

* 11/19/2024
** Summary
Good day. Didn't run but had a very calm, focused morning. Finished
the bulk of the get heard work. An edge case with free user to do in
follow up. Stayed at home until Mariana got here and stayed with Leche.

Biked to work after dropping off UPS package.

Two cleanup PRs after my sprint work. One for a deprecated field and another
for an inefficient recalculation.

I like the new separation of states (work machine vs ipad vs home machine).
Things3 is also good, though highlights I should really focus on my
prioritization system. I think re-reading GTD will be the third or fourth
book though. Lots to do.

Bed. Drawing something first.

* 11/18/2024
** Summary
Good day. From 8-2pm were meetings. Wow. Finished the Zeitgeist
ticket after work but from 2-4 not super focused.

Chores and drawing after work. Listened to an interview with
Peter Thiel. Didn't get all chores done but close to.

Bed.

* 11/17/2024
** Summary

This weekend flew by. The house is looking more organized and nearly
"done" for this recent facelift. Notable changes:

bookshelf reduced, hallways closet drawers are accessible, boxes in
the garage, organized game room and laundry, office space is super
focused and wires off the ground.

iPad came yesterday, continued the Alex Griggs animation class yesterday.

Leaning into this devices refactor. No laptop use at home (except if at
work) and that should be at the treadmill / in office. iPad is for ingestion,
 planning, discovery, drawing, illustration, learning. Mac is for development
and building the plans set from the planning device (ipad, and to a
lesser extent, iphone)

I watched a skillshare course on creative time management this creator called
the JUMP method: Just Use Minutes Productivly. The gist being: if the word
"work" gets you down (it doesn't), reframe as JUMP tasks which are 20-minute
timeboxed events. Not pomodoro since you don't get a 5-minute break. More like
Dimitri Martin's spreadsheet of points to award himself.

Made a pesto with cashew and leftover basil. It's okay. Fueling my
run tomorrow.

iPad github editor is reasonable. I forgot to commit this change while at
cafe but client remembered local changes (even though it looked like it hid
them).

Watched more of the animation course and did more examples. Learned of the
concept of "The Switch" which is basically slight of hand for animation.
Change an object from one to another at the fast point (the cut).

Going to read Marie Kondo's book first, then Refactoring and will probably
encourage the team to do it too. Maybe we'll do a book club.

** Summary
Slept in. Felt great. Stuff purge on Monday felt good but lots of
stuff still hanging on. Office space looking great though. The plan is
to get Kon Mari books soon, but store them in the garage for now.

Tomorrow Leche has vet appointment, then workfing from the office.

** Summary
I woke up and sluggishly attempted the run. Felt pretty congested and
back ache so I took a shot of cayenne pepper water on an empty stomach
thinking it would help wake me up. About 2min into walking toward my
run it kicked in and I felt like I was gonna throw up or poop my pants
so I ran home in a hurry. Cayenne pepper apparently is a good
stimulant for this on an empty stomach. Worked better than coffee!

WFH and got the icon button sorted. Tested tomorrow's prod deploy with
Tim.

Caught up with Islam who's at rifussion. Talked about the "learning
man" idea.

Drew some frogs after work. Excited for ipad and
headphones. Headphones might be a treat for next year though. Haven't
decided. I basically really like studying with white noise and have
become so accustomed to it, I separate myself from loud noises if I
don't have headphones. Limiting TV and internet time will be important
for kids. Project based is how I see it. Homework, physical exercise
and extra curricular learning before any content surfing.

* 11/12/2024
** Summary
Yesterday was a big "konmari" day. I haven't read the book but I
assume it means, get rid of a bunch of crap.

Seeking order and prediction, not explicitly but good flows. Cleaning,
tidying, removing brings this front and center.

Garage is going to look really organized and the house already does
too. Still have to box old tech and setup new work station but focus
is good.

Work at SC today was fuzzy. Design ask is unfortunate but I made my
argument. I'm stepping in designer territory with my suggestions
because it is a matter of visual taste, but I suspect it'll come
back. We'll see.

Garage will store much of the disorder until ready. New rhythms need
to be set, build up the pressure slowly and transform.

Reading in bed.

** Summary

Nice weekend. Woke up with congested sinuses but cleared later. iPad
11" + mac mini will be my setup of the future. I don't program
(seriously) on my mbp while travelling and if i needed to (tj), i
could bring the mac mini. Getting reading, processing and time
management upgraded force upgraded will be great. I want to code but
have to be at my desk to code. All of my best projects are done at the
desk anyway.

Lastly, the iPad can act as a second recording device so I can create
more videos. Starting up the MBC videos again.

Three day weekend. Mariana and I are starting "The Power", a book she
picked up and I wanted to join her on. YA fiction I think.

Tomorrow on the holiday, I'm going to tidy some stuff in the office,
laundry, closet and garage in preparation for the home system.

Better focus today. Didn't do my workout before work though. That is a
good goal. The model is: exercise + start executing the goals before
any work in the morning. Clarity.

Tomorrow morning at 8, call with Dad. Before then, run, workout, start
conferences list.

Remember bandcamp as source of content. Don't forget about tiktok
channel.

Kind of frustrated that SC won't comp the ipad purchase, especially if
I'm using some designs for work. Still possible.

Walking Leche then bed.

** Summary
Post election day, admittedly glued to news. Not productive nor
healthy nor a good example for the future. That's a good model I'd
like to focus on: "is this good?"

Spoke at our morning arch meeting of our "Zeitgeist" proposal. Too
much sugar for dinner--I think--makes me ill tempered and
on-edge. Sugar as in simple carbs. We went to a taco place in little
japan town. Food, yes. $80 for meal prepared without much love.

Thinking more about God.

Too much screen today. Ran in the morning. Woke up (accidentally) at

** Summary

Daylightsaving time. Intended to run in Venice with David but he slept
in due to little sleep from watching Remi. Took Leche on a long
walk. My normal run route but with her. She loved it. We ran for a few
segments. Mariana went on a photoshoot with her boxing class. I did my
CC exercises, booked the PDX marathon race then cleaned the table in
the garage. Cleaned the kitchen. Busy work, but necessary.

Went to commissary to plan out MBC work. Not much, just that I'll cold
call tomorrow and make new pitches to 10 conferences in March (and
attendees).

To streamline things, maybe I should make a sales page? Similar format
as before except with a focus of conference use.

Watched "Perfect Blue" before bed. Creepy, layered film. Music is
probably most creepy. Speaking of creepy going to read "The Power"
with Mariana. It's in her book queue (in Spanish) so I got the English
version.

Run in the morning.

** Summary
Morning meetings can suck energy out of you. Deployed then rolled
back. Patches to debug some more.

Soup for dinner. Biked to store for cauliflower. No exercise, minimal
walking. Cleared out things list.

Deciding what new work setup will be. MBP + ipad mini is where I'm
leaning. Don't need the computer on the ipad unless I start using more
video editing features, which would still be better on mbp. M4 will go
long time, who knows if as long as my current desktop.

Alternative is: mac mini + ipad but loose flexibility on moving around
the house (which i tend to do often while Mariana at home.

Had call with Taylor Troesh. Tools for smart folks to raise money
would be great; mentorship stuff would be great.

** Summary
Went for run in the morning. Excellent. 3.2 miles up and down the road
along the bay in Kotor. Read after until Mariana got up. Cold plunge
in bay (she said she would join but got scurred today). Breakfast down
by the water after.

Walked into town looking for bikes to rent. Found none so had beach
day in sun. Swam a bit and continued to read "Project Hail
Mary". Finished it later in the day. Inspiring.

Specifically, he keeps a tight focus on the subject matter: save the
planet. No philosophical wanderings, existential fear mongering, just
high school science setting which hopefully inspires people. I'll
admit, it did have me longing to be back in physics class working out
fun problems. Then again, they were already solved problems. Working
on "real world" problems is a joy in its own right.

Will recommend the book to most but especially anyone with any "hard
science fiction" leanings. A sequel would be fun.

** Summary

We've been in the Balkans for the last week. Great time. Took about a
week before it started feeling like "vacation". I'll explain. First it
was just "no work or daily errands"-sort of energy. Mostly fulfilling
the things Mariana set wanted to do / stick to the itinerary. That
energy still remains, because I'm happy with a nice view, a book, some
good exercise and creative exercises. Once we got to Kotor,
Montenegro, however the whole vibe shifted. Albania was nice and had
some good laughs but felt the stress of the population there.

Nice to be a fly on the wall for a bit, but also something to get away
from on holidays.

It's made me evaluate the role vacation has in my and Mariana (and by
extension, everyone else's) lives. Planning for them is not such a bad
thing and it can happen in tandem with our other goals. I don't need
to eat every penny and I shouldn't burn them all either.

Some more fun details about the trip:

We flew in to Boston from LAX, then to London Heathrow on an A380! As
of 2024, there are only ~1300 in flight. Incredible machine. Air bus
indeed! Luckily no one was in our third seat so Mariana stretched and
slept. I can't stress how excited I was to fly on that plane. The main
cabin seems like 4x the volume of a standard trans-atlantic
plane. Bathrooms in the back were huge too.

Our connecting flight in London got delayed and rescheduled to a
double flight. When we landed in London, we spoke with British Airways
to request the honor our original plan with a direct flight to Tirana,
Albania. They did and put us up in a hotel for the night. Excellent!
We took a shuttle to the hotel which wasn't ready for us when we go
there. Joked with the hotel staff who unknowingly tried to take my
pen; later he escorted a different guest and said "I'm coming back for
that pen, sir!".

Mariana passed out in the hotel lobby while we waited for our room to
be ready. I continued reading "Project Hail Mary" which I recently
read was a great page-turner. It is, in a very High School /
University engineering student way. Lots of good ol math, physics,
chemistry applied in a SF story. Not sure when we started calling it
"speculative fiction", but I think you'd call this "hard speculative
fiction". I do enjoy the prose and only find myself wanting to skip
through it occassionally. That tends to happen in the story when I
already know the objective and the rest is sort of filler text
describing the hunt for / action to do known outcome. EG: "he's
looking for the engine in the dark...he finds the engine in the dark"

Almost done with it after having a few good reading sessions. It'll
make a fun movie.

Alright, more on Kotor, Montenegro. This place is incredible. Maybe
part of the delayed "vacation" response comes from simply starting in
a city instead of "nature". Visit Kotor and see what I mean. It's a
beautiful bay surrounded by mountains. Possibly the best landscape
I've ever seen. Mariana and I were glowing when walked around
yesterday. Had pasta dinner by the bay after exploring downtown for a
bit. The town is filled with cats and has a small one-lane road
bordering the bay. Perfect for running. I woke up on the wrong side of
the bed after having said I would wake up for a run and didn't. Poor
planning on my part after restless night sleep (cold and no
sheets). Also I didn't plan for if I would take the key or
not. Tomorrow, I'll wake Mariana up and just run with the phone.

There is a marathon every December in Kotor. 2024 is out of reach but
possible 2025. A good time to make a baby too.

It's nice to eat out but at some point on vacations it always creeps
up on us: we should start cooking at home more. This thought has crept
up less because we haven't budgeted or talked about it well
enough. I'll start those discussiones tonight.

We went on a 3 hour boat tour today then came back for grocery
(prunes, ramen, tomorrow's breakfast) trip. Mariana ate a dunner, I
had ramen + cabbage + eggs cooked at home. Swam by the lake for a bit
and read book then listened to "Atomic Habits" and wrote
notes. Going to city for wall hike then dinner.

Things I'm thinking are required for next trip:
- sleeping bags/sheets to avoid the blanket problem
- portable water heater / tea or stove

** Summary
Nothing but SC work today. Deployed prod. Got draft PR paired with
Kristen ready for review. Worked on the default export draft.

Discussed LD expenditures. I have an animation idea inspired by the
logo purchase.

After work did a lap around the block with Leche.f She liked
it. Mariana went to see baby Remi.

** Summary
Woke up, gave Zeitgeist 25 talk, walked Leche. Standup, then
refinement with breakfast of salad and eggs. Coffee at home.

Deployed at 4pm then rolled back because Tommy saw a bug in his multi
track form. Team could not repro the bug but we rolled back (after
some difficulty).

Ordered Pasta Sisters for dinner. Walk with Mariana and Leche.

MBC made offer to someone who uploaded but didn't purchase. Will try
Github offer again after vacation.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am for workout with Mariana. She slept in after bargaining
for 730. Good to do weights again. Still went for a run after
work. Biked to office and found a great solution for permalink
problems.

After work solidified our Zeitgeist comments to a doc proposal and PR
drafts for others to own.

Had a bean and cheese burrito from Cerviteca. Not great. Most burrito
joints need to add rice for their bean and cheese to be solid.

** Summary
Noisy day. Started with debugging the analytics data with Bri and
Brian. Configured properly. Went for a run after work. Felt better.

Bought some stuff for trip and upgrade backpack so I can use in case I
bike to grocery store or farmers market on Tuesdays. Convenience
upgrade. No car needed.

DMV mailed paper work.

Wished Maru a happy birthday. Joey's birthday too but I can't contact
him while he's in TJ. Hope he had a good one.

** Summary
Good day. Went for another midday run. Did a short bench workout. Some
air squats and situps. Watched "Signs" with Mariana, she didn't enjoy
it.

Played pickleball a little.

City cut down two huge trees one street over. Giant trees, maybe 50+
years old.

** Summary
Felt like crap for most of the morning. No movement recently. Went for
a run after a long walk with Mariana and Leche. Went "top roping" at
cliffs of id for the first time. Mariana loved it. I'm not a huge fan
of the heights part but the indurance is good exercise and will get me
more comfortable with heights with more practice.

Went for Pho dinner then watched "The Sixth Sense", Mariana's first
time. She loved it. Didn't see the twist coming at all. We're gonna
watch "Signs" next.

** Summary
Went to office and identified improvements to upload. Worked on a
refactor to overquota. Hairy.

Qatar package got stuck so called DHL. International call dialed then
gave up. Left email on their web form and will send again via personal
email. Really hope it gets delivered.

Broke fast with dates and big bowl of oatmeal. Regressed on the right
solution for this problem, but have a good one. We're in a holding
pattern on merges for some reason. Tomorrow I'm going to the office
for all hands with Leche.

* 09/23/2024
** Summary
Intense weekend. Joey will be leaving rehab soon so in solidarity I
went to an open AA meeting to learn more from people in similar
circumstances. There I learned of "AL Anon" which is focused for
friends and family of those in AA. Still, I bought "the big blue book"
to try to understand what my brother is going through to. Speak the
same language. Some intense but conversations because of yesterday's events.

Went to the park on Sunday to slackline and picnic with Sam &
Elle. Great seeing them. Demo'd MBC to Tim who had some good feedback
re subscription model.

Can make a really fun consumer product.

Not very focused today, but got a handle of remaining work on this
ticket. A bunch of meetings and an interview.

Very little fiber today. Ate like trash. Fiber feel good. Ginger shots
recipe tomorrow or wednesday. Made agua fresca for Mariana. Laundry too.

"Living for the weekend" is really silly way to live. I get frustrated
when chores and "the needs" of our life get put off (often by
necessity due to not having the car possibly) till the weekend but
conflict with scheduled fun. "Can't eat your pudding if you haven't
had your meat" typeshit

** Summary
Initial rollout at SC then a bunch of meetings. Have solution for the
hoisted context problem. Ate like trash in the evening. Both digital
content and food. The salad i've been breaking my fast with recently
was great and left me balanced, good digestion.

Lettuce, kale, avocado, cucumber, tomato (sometimes), sweet pepper,
beans (sometimes), olives, nooch, salt, pepper. The olives are clutch.

Today I ate: green tea, matcha breakfast smoothy (banana, oatmeal,
protein powder, matcha, oatmilk), fried rice for lunch after SC
provided grubhub was cancelled, some dates and for dinner two
hashbrown fried potatoes with some brocolli grated into it and 4
scrambled eggs on top.

** Summary
Caught up rest. Amazing sleep. Biked to office. Bug bash and confirmed
high pri ticket. Photoshoot day. Found solution to other issue with
Jon. Went to see Remi, Pau and David after work.

Went for a run at home. Felt great. 40min in total, 30min around the
park. Walked Leche a few times. Ate a salad while Mariana and I
watched "the Last Man on Earth"

Bed.

** Summary
Home. GoNogo this morning and bugfixes ahead of launch. Looks good
now. Rough sleep and start/end to the day. Tidied kitchen and
table. Cooked Leche food. Washed car.

Lunar eclipse on the full moon. Leche and I saw the last bit of it on
our evening walk. Day dreaming about sleeping on grass

Sleep tea a few hours ago. Kicking in. Bed.

* 09/16/2024
** Summary
Debug day and had to revert a prod change. Good teamwork but boy could
the rhythms be better. Rest tonight for that cause.

Mailing UPS to Qatar tomorrow after go/nogo.

** Summary
Life is good. Stretched thin now and had some sour, resentful feelings
so I fasted Saturday and Sunday. Broke each at sunset with a salad
then tofu curry.

Talked with Mariana about the future tonight. Played pickleball earlier.

Ready to mail the Qatar demo.

Long day. Took over Dianna's ticket. Talked with Andrew's brother
Alex. Watched "Trapped" with Mariana and had Simpang for
dinner. Mailing out inventory tomorrow morning. Along with filming.

* 09/11/2024
** Summary
Four PRs reviewed, fixed inheritance issue. It'll be a long weekend to
hit the deadline. The whole team is overworked or tasks are poorly
managed. I think slack is a good tool, but boy is it
distracting. Maybe the whole "developer time" "manager time" concept
is useful here. No interruptions allow for work to get done.

Really, it's the PR reviewing. When code is fixed together, it's
reviewed immediately (the driver/navigator). Can we do that
systematically?

Maybe for getting our test coverage up.

More replies on MBC. Potential sales in April. Logged scans now (but
eventually a db record, if in product).

Product(s) and platform.

Making Qatar demo in the morning.

Busy for others, busy for self, tactics for future.

Made 50 videos and started cold emailing prospects. Didn't email them
all, will do that in the morning.

Heatwave is intense. AC running often. Lots of caffeine this
weekend. Had yerba mate late at night and now can't sleep. Eating
nuts, eggs and avocado now. Going to watch a movie and hope to sleep
within the hour.

Good day. Created product for cold emails, recorded 3 pitch videos and
1 quick tiktok trend

Talked with Dad at noon and had some good flowing energy.

Played with Leche and walked for a bit but it was dang hot.

** Summary
Great day. Flowing with that new Jon Hopkins album (Ritual). Hit
backlog ticket. After work, made some promo videos to mail out.

Great focus. Yesterday's workout probably helped. Used Peets coffee in
the morning, then matcha smoothie for lunch, then green tea with
dinner.

** Summary
Fixed the SC bug. Posted new MBC after work. Needed to sweat after
work to get the juices flowing. Rough day in that regard. Running
again can help. Especially if there is a goal/target.

Also pitched Channel 5 again. Will do several more until I get a
response.

Hospitality and conferences tomorrow.

** Summary
Back from vacation and day was busy. No MBC work because I got the
house in order after work, namely: laundry, cleaned kitchen and part
of bathroom, transplanted ginkgo, some basic meal prep (cut fruit and
veg)

One man show right now and it's not focused. I can't take any more
weekend trips before vacation. Mariana will go to TJ this weekend then
all of September I'll cold call and hit our SC deadlines.

Stay focused.

** Summary
Drove up to Berkeley on Friday and back down on Monday (Labor
day). Hung out with Jered and Jacqueline all weekend, it was
great. Tacos on Friday then board game at airbnb. Cafe then Point
Reyes, beach day, then oysters on Saturday. Sunday in San Francisco at
GG park. Slack-lined, played Hanabi and Barry and her dog hung out
with us. Drove back to Oakland before this dim sum placed closed. Ate
at airbnb. Drove to Marin to have breakfast with Andrew and Nuria
before driving down.

Left at 12, got roast chicken for Leche then attempted to take "the
scenic route" down but I guess that means the 1 and not the 101. So
ate lunch in Foster City before taking was was still a nice route
down: 805 to 101 to 5 to 405.

** Summary

Arch talk. DEI talk. Standup. Walked Leche. Couldn't find bug but
found another. Pushups throughout day. Made MBC order through order
app. Need to do lifts again.

Instead of multiple conferences, focusing on one big one (Disrupt)
makes sense. Researching. After holiday, consumer app makes
sense. Maybe only when I have a real machine to build it on (new mbp)
so don't waste time on the idea. Focus on sales and outreach. If you
get 100 "no"s, then you can work on the next variant

Sleep.

Back at SC. Tested a bug. Couldn't repro, found a refactor that might
be worth doing (famous last words).

We'll do our continuous deployment for webi starting October 1st. Will
outline tickets for team members and create e2e tests before then.

Cleaned out closet (mostly). Some mold on my boots (wtf). Will see if
cleaning is effective.

Side conversation this evening with Mariana about the effectiveness of
for-profit fentynol testing services vs city controlled ones. Look at
evidence before making conclusions.

Tomorrow morning, my goal is to get a list of all tech conferences in
North America before the end of year. Second goal is to find emails
for those conferences. Reach out to David about apollo access.

Third goal: wizardhead button.

** Summary

Announced MBC via tiktok and IG on Friday. Starting sales loop next
week: reach out to conferences. Need to figure out what (if any) band
rhythm continues on tiktok. Should be "fire and forget" content. Maybe
the "lucky song" is good enough.

We went to Santa Barbara this weekend to stay with Marcella and
Omar. Lazzaro is growing up nice. A bit of mamitis at the moment but
not especially noticable once he starts playing. Apps for tracking his
sleep and food is interesting. Good idea though I suspect I'll want to
ensure the foods it encourages are okay. Yes.

We went to SB beach on Saturday and the park on
Sunday. Slack-lined. Very fun.

Drove back late. Got home at 830; I'm wiped. Tiring driving with no
light.

Bed. Waking up early to start the engines.

** Summary

I can sleep early tonight. Provisional profile filed, inventory
arrived in Santa Cruz. Screwed up and didn't submit the app to app
store last night! I noticed at 4pm so I'm still waiting to see if
apple will pick it up tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

Good feedback so far. I think I should store history of changes.

Fixed two bugs at SC.

Bed now, asleep before 11.

* 08/21/2024
** Summary
Went to bed at 3am. Fixed open issue at SC. Biked to office for lunch
and to work there for a bit. My 1 year work anniversary was
today. They gave me this little vinyl coaster

After work, filed for a provisional patent on my idea. Cutover
production site. Discovered ios darkmode issue thanks to Jered and
Jacqueline testing. Deployed the fix for apple to review by 2am (for
both android and ios). Will be great when i get new computer. Can do
all my building on one device instead of juggling my two ancient work
machines. Actually, even with a new machine, it's nice to have the old
laptop as the print/receipt station. The desktop will probably be kept
as a web browser only. No fancy or fast compute on it.

Going to post launch video and first tiktok shop product
tomorrow. I'll start demoing the product more and more in the coming
weeks. The way I see it, bangbangcon is already the big marketing
stunt.

** Summary
Bed late last night and again today. Third app store submission
requested, basic launch video though I think it could be tighter.

At SC, responding to all feedback on PR, started looking into new bug
and reviewed a few PRs. Then got a late night page from Tommmy about
track manager.

Mailed package to bangbangcon.

Provisional patent is almost ready. Need sleep.

Website cutover tomorrow with some basic video example. Embed youtube
is fine. Constrain dimensions. SC work will be more bug bashing.

Community lunch in the office maybe.

* 08/19/2024
** Summary

After some tedious debugging, got the distro cap modal work sorted
out. After work, packed order for bangbangcon and juggled building new
version of app. Old hardware makes the test loop slow (remote build,
async unbound time waiting for apple).

Had a bit of a scare but just before attempting to deploy a patch for
more exploring; realized it was user (me) error in the write
process. Yes!!!! Consistent production and reading modes now.

Tomorrows work is video creation, provisional patent and production
cutover. Also packaging and mailing the buttons for
bangbangcon. Ziplock bags + padding in big box? Probably good
call. UPS or USPS?

For SC work tomorrow, get us set up with Rive animation. More bug
backlog. Ping Lunch.js.

** Summary
Android app looks good, made order for bangbangcon, printed backing
for it which looks aaaaawesome. Inspiring for consignment.

Apple and Android play store submitted for review. Should test again
on android (the modal).

After day job, tomorrow's focus is to package and mail bangbang and file the
provisional patent.

* 08/17/2024
** Summary
MBC android is running on device but eas play store submission isn't
working. Maybe once first/non-draft state works.

Some layout oddities. Made intro gifs albeit suuuuuper fast because I
only had Mariana's phone for 30min. Can update it later in the
week. Not a deal breaker, but better to get the intro video nailed.

Made buttons for the family. Felt good. Talked with Jason for a bit
and played solo pickleball with Mariana for a bit.

** Summary
Long day. Good. Went to office with Leche. Paired with Jeff on sc4a
bug. Fixed then did my work. Leche roamed around freely in the
office. Had to throw her food away because ants got to it really quick.

Mariana is really enjoying her boxing class and I'm happy for
her. She's doing kickboxing next. Maybe both though.

MBC is almost ready with ios and android apps. Provisional patent by
Monday. Test using special cardstock paper is awesome but too many
unknowns so I ordered another type. Thinness/weight is a huge
factor. Maybe some without sticker backing?

If none of those work, plain ol design is the way to go.

** Summary
Some conflicts on work today with other devs. Repro'd how to fix but
then had to rebase after Jeffs work. Github also went down making
things even more fun.

Did a lift after work. My neck is better after that tweak (two weeks
ago) and I felt pretty good in the hours to follow.

After work, charged my old android phone to test expo app, made custom
tiktok shop order, login working, app looks good. Need to confirm it
works on android then its production polish (gifs) after making test
assets. Should be able to submit by EOD tomorrow.

** Summary
Woke up. Deep sleep. Synced with Janik on upload ticket. Dove into the
sc4a modal condition ticket. Hairy.

After work, nearly finished the consumer mobile app. Have to do all
builds through eas until i get a new machine (waiting for m4) since
it's near the end of release cycle.

EAS updates should work (as a codepush alternative) though cost $ per
user install. That's fine for now, but maybe codepush is better if its
still in development. Tradeoffs since I'll hit EAS cap anyway. It's
expensive to be poor as they say.

New build is going up, then bed. Tomorrow wfh.

** Summary

Super deep sleep. Wrote some tests for SC. Sprint planning too. After
work, MBC ready to share with family. Also fulfilled order (one for 16
items, the other for 10 free).

Super hot today. Took Leche on a mid day walk. Scorching.

Got create user and login done for the app. User creds are important
if I ever want to add features and not just a utility. Maybe after
launch. Testflight by EOW. Submit to app store then too.

Mail demos on Wednesday (priority if not too expensive)

** Summary
Pretty good day. Not as much done as yesterday. I really do fly when I
have long periods of focused time and my thoughts. Adaptable though.

Grocery shopped in evening after getting basic ios scaffold up (intro
slides mostly done, create user api done but not integrated).

Made a cucumber, pepper and black bean salad. Roasted some tomatoes,
onion, garlic, jalepeno for salsa. Started cooking Leche's food.

Bed.

* 08/10/2024
** Summary
Caught up on sleep. Bed at 1am (ish) and woke up at 10am. Started MBC
work by 1pm. Juggled laundry but did a lot. Tomorrow the consumer
app. Got the new costume from Ian and Jay-Yu on Friday. Client app
finished tomorrow, then dynamic shipping estimation from address, then
email / customer scripts (tracking code email)

Shipping rates is more important. Do that

After about 4 hours of focused time, went to Echo park with Mariana to
meet Andrew and Moti who invited us to row boats on the lake. Ate
sandwiches at park. There was a guy with downsyndrome dancing for
money. We first rode our swan boat as far as we could before getting
yelled at that we went past the bouey boundary. Afterward, walking
back to the car, a group of dudes were recording rap battle between
two dudes. In Spanish. Fun time. Came home and did the prod cutover.

* 08/08/2024
** Summary

Biked to office. Dropped off another MBC order on the way. Tiktok shop
is mostly smooth process.

Fixed bug at work. After work, got fulfillment APIs written and
partially integrated in app.

Focusing on that tomorrow at cafe after work.

** Summary
Not much sleep last night while trying to figure out Xcode issue. EAS
for the win. Our intern Anna demo'd her summer project and the team
loved it.

Fixed a bug; had going away empanadas.

Back home, got the admin app working (basics).  Should refactor it to
"Step 1 -- Step 2 -- Confirm -- Finalize". The finalization step will
help show when order is done. Return count in response and alert.

** Summary

Mariana was still super sick this morning. High fever and couldn't
stomach food. Fever went down later but no fun being weak.

FE interview candidate today. Resubmitted sc4a bug fix.

Spent several hours trying to get RN app compiled on my ancient
machine. Later versions of xcode are required to build most of the RN
tool chain and delever via testflight or other. Unfortunately later
versions of xcode only run on newer hardware. Backporting RN to older
versions seemed promising but then the testflight sdk requirements for
distribution got in the way.

Was almost ready to sleep but then looked for hosted xcode solutions
and remembered expo has one! Several others out there too. One of them
should solve

** Summary
Shipped 3 MBC orders although tiktok tracking says waiting to
receive. We'll see if one gets refunded because of that.

SC bug bash and ack'd Jeff's feedback. Tired. Jumped rope to get the
blood flowing.

Mariana is sick with sore throat and now fever. Stayed home and
rested. Made some soup and got some otc drugs for her. Leche is good
girl and sits with her as she knows she feels bad.

Admin MBC app nearly done though i'm having to jump through hoops to
get it working on old machine. They're on their last leg so I'll start
budgeting for new one.

After M4 mbp come out would be a good target. Need to spec it. Desktop
lasted 10 years, laptop lasted 13. Good times. They're still great,
just not daily drivers.

Need to lower MBC admin dependency versions incrementally. App builds
just fine, but major/minor versions are messing with xcode.

A few more organic (no marketing) sales on tiktok. Pickleball in the
evening. Fun. Played two cocky old timers. They were better but we
scared them and held a lead

Have order fulfillment script done. Need to compile RN on old machine,
but POC nearly done.

Bed with meditation.

** Summary

Woke up and got coffee from Coffee Bean. Worked on order fulfillment
script MBC. Went to Venice from 1-4 then Northgate market, then walked
Leche, then packed an order for MBC. Didn't plan on it, but finally
tested the tiktok shop process.

Let's see how it pans out after USPS drop off tomorrow.

Pickleball with Mariana after a few hours at home. Played with new
friends out there Carlos and Maggie then Ash and Jackie.

Sunburned a bit. Incredible Sun today, no breeze, clear sky, not too
hot. Noticeably amazing Sun.

** Summary
Couldn't sleep so stayed up for MBC polish. Receipt + emails then
order fulfillment flow. Then app. Then videos.

SC work was bug bashing and fixed one. Went to office with Leche who
liked growling at the neighbor cat.

Thinking about the Universe again.

Pickleball with Mariana after work.

Listened to Toumani Diabate.

** Summary

Good day. Neck tweak was funny. Doesn't hurt as bad as camping trip
injury but somehow related. Thinking about it.

SC4A work. Got a ping from Ben Upsavs. Lady who works at Rose Market
gave me a free almond croissant as Leche and I were walking home. That
was nice.

WFH office tomorrow

Great day. YOLO. Workout in morning. New MBC launch date and plan.

Woke up, walked Leche to farmers market for coffee while Mariana went
to kickball. Read more of 1PMP. Went to beach with Mariana and
Leche. Met David, Pau and Remi. Paddleboard. There was some seaweed on
the floor of the bay that we kept stepping on and freaking out
thinking we were stepping on stingray of fish. Hilarious.

Came home and washed Leche. She's getting really responsible and
jumped in the tub by herself. Mariana washed her, I dried. I drove to
Sprouts and Smart & Final after for some weekly groceries and Leche's
chicken.

Made a soyrizo pasta. Leche had eggs. She's wiped from today and tried
to go to bed early.

Going to bed.

** Summary
Woke up to play golf with Jon at Rancho. Fun game but I realize I
don't have time for golf right now so will delay it till the new year
or later. Worked from office. Saw capstone project demo and submitted
ffmpeg wasm issue. Reviewed some PRs

Back home, read and started part 1 of "1-page marketing plan" some
parts are tedious but it does get the juices flowing. A few personas
but will meditate on which is most viable or tactics on communicating
in one channel to multiple personas. Also in converting from my
current channel niche to a wider message format.

Watched some Shark Tank with Mariana before bed.

Tomorrow, I'll continue the avatar exercise, more on the 1pmp and get
automatic emails setup. Later, tidy the code and start studying
drizzle. Run through a demo of it on d1 to get familiar.

** Summary
Woke up, arch talk about tools I find valuable. Leche walk, refinement
later, focus session (no coworkers interested), fixed wasm issue. Did
a quick lift. Salad and beans for lunch. Coffee walk with Leche. After
work, modified the MBC cropper. Maybe better to hire a designer before
launch? Focus on getting enough done so I can make adverts for
it. Sept is advert creation time.

* 07/16/2024
** Summary
Day flew by. Deep dreams and a bit of sleep talking I caught myself
in. Woke up with allergy attack still. Walked Leche, went biked to
work, worked on wasm issue. 100 pushups while at work. Lunch with Jon
and Adam, talked about "first fans".

Bug bash with team.

Walked Leche a few times after work.

Researched "successful side projects" launched while founders had full
time job. Spanx, cards against humanity, go pro, tattly

Bed. Will workout in the morning before early calls.

** Summary
Weaning coffee until I have a plan for MBC. Fixed big bug today. Kinda
overwhelmed but writing helps. Walked on treadmill during work. Did a
rushed workout after. Laundry later. Played with Leche at
lunch. Leaving windows open during the day is just as good as
AC. Better really. Avoid social media if I'm not posting.

- financial report

** Summary

Back from 5 day vacation in La Paz for Mariana's birthday. Didn't open
the computer once. I notice angst when thinking of side product launch
in November. Need to create a plan because my morning routine is
struggling. Even this routine (nightly summaries) is struggling. Very
easy to slip into thousands of tiktok videos and get lost in the
noise. Open question is: what does the video rhythm look like and do I
pre-record those videos or not?

I'm not reading, writing side code/product or exercising regularly
which explains the unease.

Calm. Patience. Unplug and create start the plan before October.

Write down everything on your mind, estimate complexity, order
it. Document milestones and options for the future.

SC work is okay. Upload will be very polished by launch.

Going to bed with a postive meditation.

Woke up to play golf with Jon from work. Par 3 course in south
pasadena. Fun. 40min back to Palms. Biked to work. Added tests to my
code after lots of PR reviews. Also worked on Rive margin problem Luke
noted. Need to understand how resizing canvas can be controlled.

Watched "What we do in the shadows" show with Mariana and dimsum
delivery.

** Summary

Woke up, 830am Creator SOS call. Will be good to have more focus on
upload. The MBC video post didn't post, so tried it again before work.

Got a solution the team agrees on for inherited fields. Need tests.

Fixed animation with Izzy. Chat with Sarah about upload states.

Did a group workout with Travis and Brandon.

Bennys tacos for dinner. Leafy greens will be good. Been having a lot
of bean, rice and cheese burritos. Lazy but tasty food.

Mariana asked for 3 weeks vacation in October. Will wait for answer
but need to get mind right.

Golfing with Jonathan tomorrow morning.

Woke up, EPD meeting at 730, PT at 9am, standup at 10, biked to
office, focused on the parent -> trackList problem. Benny's tacos for
lunch. Biked home. Played with Leche for a minute. Longboarded with
Mariana in the street. Cooked picadillo (turkey and tofu). Prototyped
image preview code for MBC. Writing an e2e test for each major link
type would be good. Could be as simple as a script that cURLs.

** Summary

Woke up, made coffee and hour of power with Dad. Good call. Pretty
close to MBC launch. Get focused.

Leche woke up at 3:30am to Leche walking around asking to go
outside. She wanted to eat grass so I sat outside while watching the
moon while she ate grass. Probably 10min. Good sleep though.

Hot day, stayed inside with AC. Some edge cases to work on album
ticket.

Mariana and I have been doing a 14 day fitness challenge with her
boxing class. Missed the last three days so I did them all after
work. Went to grocery store after. Spent more than usual because there
wasn't a strong grocery list. Also more staples.

Woke up early to meet Jai-Yu and Ian for there stuff. Biked to office
for all-hands. Biked home to walk Leche after standup. Bug in upload
Jeff found. Wrote tests and pinged team. Discovered a prod but after
Diana asked an edge case question. Patched bug.

Wrote BDD for MVP of MBC. Some more stuff can be trimmed but i like
it. KISS. Don't stress about re-design or anything. Focus on the pitch
videos.

** Summary
Had the day off today for Juneteenth. Made videos for MBC tiktok and
scheduled them...but turns out scheduling via desktop lowers
viewership.

Went to lindy hop and it's starting to make sense.

Bennys tacos after.

Also a long day. Woke up, went to PT. Walked Leche, biked to

tests. Biked for lunch. Venice (Gjelina) for anniversary (2 part 2)

* 06/17/2024
** Summary
Back at work. Lots of context shifting (slack messages) after sprint
planning. Figured out the AdvancedSettings issue and reviewed a huge
PR.

Chinese leftovers (tofu, rice, greens) for lunch. Jumped rope after
work. Mariana went to boxing class then we did a 15min boxing warmup
after. We're doing a 14 day boxing challenge with her class.

Showered then went to smart & final for Leche's food. Tomorrow have PT
in the morning. Not going to schedule any more. Waste of money.

Researched D1 a bit and looked into "drizzle" ORM tool. Seems
promising. Maybe less risk than other cloud dbs (cloudflare, i mean,
though drizzle is pretty popular)

** Summary
Got loads done this weekend. Bulk pricing model, now on tiktok
shop. Shared the product I'm launching in Sept with Ian and
Jay-Yu. Had coffee with them on Saturday then lunch on Sunday with a
workout thrown in there. Nice. Matthew and Bree were in town for a
show and hung out at our place before the show. Mariana was in TJ for
the weekend. Long walks with Leche. It was pretty on hot so she took
her time. I know I'm mentally preoccupied. Slowing down on weekends
like now to do chores is great.

Anniversary dinner on Tuesday. Juneteeth holiday on Wednesday. Most of
this week is about refactoring

** Summary
Hanging in there. Good energy for most of the day. Workout in the
morning before arch talk. Venice after work to have dinner with Ian
and Jai-Yu. Moved it to the german hotdog place after seeing the place
in Venice was closed. How to train for hangry?

Good to bounce ideas off Jai-Yu and Ian. Delivered the second round of
buttons they ordered. Three veggie hotdogs and fries for me.

** Summary
Words are important. As my teachers used to say, "some people have
diarrhea of the mouth" suggesting they don't think before they
speak. Good to think on.

Tomorrow, deep focus on the form problem. Stillness. New sprint work
for Anna. I have a PT appointment at 11am (silly) and our lunch
outting after. I'll only make part of the PT appointment before
heading into the office.

Nosotros hablamos solomente en espanol los martes ahora. Empieza manana.

Beditation.

** Summary
Fasted today until noon. Felt good. Broke it with a salad (kale,
cucumber, pepper, tomato, bellbepper, beans).

Arch meeting at 8am, updated testing doc based on the team chat, sc4a
feature is nearly done but needed to help get Anna VPN access then
debug her ticket. Good progress though.

Thermal printer arrived. Mailing out latest order tomorrow during lunch.

Color printer is fixed. It probably works better with brighter,
heavier paper. Investigating

Lindy Hop at 8pm. Fun today, practiced basics (1-2, tripple step) and
learned the "square off" and turn.

Walked Leche afterwards

** Summary
Rushed day because I went to bed late and woke up early. No reason,
just bad planning and stayed glued to phone looking for good songs and
musicians.

PT in the morning, quick walk with Leche, biked to office, sprint
planning and met our summer intern, debugged a prod issue with
Axinja. Order fulfillment for MBC. Had to got to Staples since ink
appears messed up. That forced me to upgrade toner cartridges. Found
some that are within return policy and significantly cheaper than
HP brand toner. Fingers crossed.

Also made a short video for a musician.

Scrolled and book marked some new music and artists to promote. Stayed
up pretty late though, maybe because of 3pm matcha.

Leche stayed at the house from 930am till 3pm(ish) by herself. Took
her on a long walk and played with her after. Intended to be back by 1
but needed to wait for Anna to get her computer.

Bed.

Chores today. Felt good. Did workout. Not all chores I wanted but good
start. Waking up early to drop Mariana off for a hike she's doing with
her boxing class.

Went to the Santa Monica pier to play DDR and ride two rides (the
ferris wheel and the flippy sidewinder one). Fun.

Thinking about shipping options for MBC product. Shipping APIs is a
new challenge. I could do free shipping for minimum orders $5 shipping
anywhere in the USA? Shipping outside USA?

Home now, going to bed.

** Summary
Back from the long weekend in Santa Barbara. Drove over on Saturday
night, stayed at Motel 6 near the beach. Great location, reasonable
hotel (too small though) with a tiny pool Mariana liked. Got a good
laugh when we arrived because the photos make the pool look massive.

Day one we had late lunch at a tavern. Lazarro is looking healthy. Two
bottom teeth coming in. Mariana taught him a funny game. She stuck out
her tongue to make faces at him. He loved it and tried to mimic
her. Apparently he's blowing raspberries too.

The next day we drove over to Goleta to see Omar and Marcella at their
place. We walked to the beach and saw a snake on the way. About a 3
footer. It had just eaten. The beach was "no dogs" so we didn't let
Leche run freely. Other owners did but we don't have great recall with
her. Especially not when there are that many birds on the shore. She
loved it though. Found a great walking stick too. Almost the one I had
beend dreaming of for MBC but not quite. My vision is fuzzy on that
and didn't want to bring something I wasn't going to use, so I left
it.

Monday, I woke up and walked to coffee. Leche and Mariana slept
in. When back, we walked to the beach. I went to pick up breakfast
which took longer than expected because the spot we picked (Jeannie's
on the beach) had a shortened to-go menu. Found a bakery near by that
looked good. Delicious hashbrowns formed and fried in a square with
some curry seasoning. Mariana didn't want any until I stressed how
good they were. Right on time, Leche flung up a torrent of sand that
landed all over the hashbrowns. Womp womp. Funny though.

We drove over to Goleta again for another late lunch, this time at a
natural foods place around the corner from them. Delicious. I had a
tempeh burger and slice of carrot cake. Drove home and was back in a
foggy LA by 6 or so. On the way, our oil light came on so I topped us
off at the gas station.

The new rule is to top us off before any long trip. Which means
outside LA.

Today, I had a sinus attack and was pretty annoyed by it. Went to PT
at 2pm and had enough pause of my sinuses draining during to still
stretch properly. Pain in shoulder is getting better. Motion is the
key to success here.

Mariana doesn't like the 30-60-90 incline bench design and poo-poo'd
it. Maybe she'll change her mind, but if not, I might buy an incline /
decline combo. More expensive than the triangle, but less expensive
(in dollars and time) than building one and have that fall apart in a
few years.

Took a benedryl to help sleep. Going to bed soon.

Woke up, pull ups outside. Ate like trash today, will bounce
back. Coffee in the morning, coffee smoothie from earth bar, free
donut from yesterday's all hands, egg burritos (solid), tofu bahn mi
and some fried movie theater spring rolls and buffalo
cauliflower. Silly.

Went to see Remi with Mariana before watching Furiosa at Culver
Theater. Played with Leche a bit before.

** Summary

Woke up and walked 4miles during the all hands. Lots of Billy Eilish
talk. Bug fixed. Mariana wrapped Leche's foot last night. This morning
Leche was nipping at it and took off most of it. Probably ate some too.

Lifted. Bent over rows seem to help. Good I was warmed up.

Loose attention today after work. Didn't make any videos for MBC. Down
on that. I think my own progressive/growth idea is to get through this
book I'm reading then "figure out" what's next. Reminded of a chat
back in SF with Tony about how (then) I developed the confidence to
stop a book mid reading if I lost interest. I've since change my mind
on that (maybe after having too much free time on my hands back
then). A balance to strike or a hard rule? Library books or a better
reading habit are great for that. If I chew threw a book per week or
per night, it's not the end of the world to have a bad one. Synthesis
and retention though.

Two new patio chairs came in. They look nice. I transplated the tulsi
seeds I've been nursing for the last 3 weeks. Tonight is their first
night outside. I've been hardening them over the last week. Bringing
them out for the day, and inside for the night. Many got their own pot
but lots are sharing. Lots of plants.

* 05/22/2024
** Summary
Woke up to put "how we write tests" in slide format. Request was to
put it in a doc in our repo and open the discussion for everyone.

Fixed e2e ci tests and shared with team. Went to office with Leche for
community lunch. She was pretty well behaved. Probably went a bit nuts
because it was taco day. Her poops look healthy again though there was
some red in the second one much later in the day. No urge for her to
eat grass, lethargy or pain on her belly so keeping a watchful eye and
adding more fiber (sweet potato) to her diet.

Walked back after interview debrief with team.

Went to ballroom + lindy hop dance classes. Much better flow this time
around. Rene had a tip about back nerve pain: stress makes it worse so
try to relax. He also said stretching his knee helped the mid
back. Will try it.

Tomorrow, I'll start 5x5 before all hands then walk at least 4miles
(preferably at 4mph if it's not too loud for the call). Break a sweat
to start the day.

Then, add the "how we test" document before the bug backlog. MBC post
needs to happen, especially since I'm away and AFK this weekend.

Bed.

* 05/21/2024
** Summary

Woke up and went to PT. Really tight today. Felt better after the
electrical stimulation and heating pad. Hurt again in the
evening. Enough to take tylenol twice. First time in a while.

Spoke with Drooker. Worked on e2e tests in CI. Intern sync. Came home
and broke fast with salad then rice and beans.

Arch meeting is on testing tomorrow. Waking up early to convert my
notes into slide format.

Leche was sick today. She through up and had a big of blood in her
stool. Either she ate something she shouldn't have or she caught a
bug. She's been on this new chicken + vegetable + rice diet for 3
weeks now (third week) and her appetite has been great but her stools
have been irregular. Maybe the blood in stool is constipation? Two
days ago she had mucus on her poop too which apparently could indicate
a stomach infection. I pressed on her stomach and sides to see if she was
sensitive but no response. Pretty confident it is a stomach bug but if
there is signs of blood in stool or she continues to want to throw up,
time for vet.

Rest.

* 05/20/2024
** Summary
Woke up at 720 and did a fast barbell workout. All empty bar while my
pinched nerve persists. Mind over matter.

Sold fern on craigslist. Tediously fixed the e2e issues. Not sure why
tests failed. Tomorrow working on arch talk.

Made picadillo for Mariana. Leche had a stange looking poop
today. First part was normal, the second part was covered in a
semi-transparent mucus. Like it was a big sinus booger wrapped
turd. Diet didn't change much yesterday, but two days ago she had eggs
and rice for dinner.

I'm reading a book that's pretty wu-wu culty right now. Lot's of
strong statements for a book that is trying to draw parallels make
metaphors between various cultural artifacts and religions. Some
interesting patterns but sometimes feels like a childrens color book.

Cut my hair after work. Feels good. Hair was looking pretty good
before but drawing my attention and too much to manage. Focus energy
on side project launching in September.

** Summary

Excited for PT tomorrow morning. What exercises can I do safely? I
suspect similar basic moves like the ones I had in SF 6 years
ago.

Got a patch deployed that Luke logged. Also merged the parallel routes work.

After work made assets for side project. Juice.

Bed and meditation.

** Summary
Maru stayed with this weekend. Came here on Thursday night, left this
morning. We went to Getty on Saturday. She spent the day with Mariana
on Sunday. I didn't do any work this week, nothing productive. Scapula
feels like its getting better, less extreme pain but some positions
still really suck.

Going to bed.

** Summary
Amazing. Scapula felt pretty okay for most of today. Up until 4pm when
it came back. Maybe it's stress induced? Doesn't explain why I woke up
with the pain in previous days. Still monitoring. Was numb at dinner
and afterward.

Maru arrived at 5pm, we walked to doughroom for dinner.

Walked back, made tulsi. Walked Leche when Mariana came home. Went to
Trader Joe's for Leche's birthday dinner and CVS for bow.

Working from office tomorrow. Reading in bed.

* 05/08/2024
** Summary
Good day. Sleep was rough. Woke up with full arm numb. Tylenol. WFH
until noon when I went to office for community lunch. Worked there for
a bit, then biked home to finish work before heading back to the
office for group pilates class. Originally planned location got
relocated to playa vista but still good. Intense stuff.

Biked home and realized I lost my keys. Scatter brained with this
arm. Never happens. Turns out I left them in the cubby at the pilates
studio. Drove there to pick them up. On the way back, made a spare key
at home depot.

Cleaned the house with Mariana and watched a rediculous amount of
tiktok videos. Some good songs to promote on MBC.

Bed.

** Summary

Life is good. Noisy right now and a monkey on my back (pinched nerve)
but it's good to be alive. I would love to feel some natural
endorphines though and feel pretty restless due to not wanting to
continue to injure myself. Maybe that fear is unnecessary. Maybe I can
still do weighted workouts, just carefully with certain range of
motion. Squats would be nice. Bench too, but I can hardly do full
pushup without hurting.

Drawing book showed up today. How am I to use this? Character design
for MBC? Animation for MBC?

Mariana went to boxing class today after work. Seemed stressed.

Mom texted photo of Houston as she gets ready for move. Nice photo.

** Summary
Shoulder and arm still pinched. Physical therapy can't come soon
enough. Swam this weekend. Fun, but I'm pretty obsessed with this
pinched nerve. I've let it control most of my mood which stinks. Pull
up strength is still trash.

MBC side project is brutal. The daily drip of posting content I've
already recorded is rough especially because it feels so heartless to
pre-record. For the next batch of pre-recorded ones, I'll note them in
different contexts (doing dishes, in shower, playing board games, etc)

Clarity please. Should probably stop CBD too. Might make the shoulder
pain harder to bear, but the angst go away.

** Summary
Some good flow today. Calisthenics to help with shoulder. What to do
for May, June, July, August? Project? More side project grinding?
Unsure. Meditating on this in bed.

** Summary
Tough day. Went to urgent care to get PT referral. Pain was rough
enough, could barely focus. Starting to cycle tylenol.

Finished sprint work today.

730 yoga. Some woman farted five times. She was struggling to keep it
in. Held in my laughter. Was tough though.

Some back and forth about the planters and plants to put in
them. Short attention span on both our parts. Detox from
screens.

Bed.

** Summary
I'm going to schedule a phone detox. When I don't set goals, I slip
into scolling. I've been pretty good with "chopping wood" type-goals
(do XYZ every day for 1 year) but those quickly turn into
non-progressive goals which eventually defeats the purpose. May, June,
July and August are all opportunities to do real stretch goals before
phase 2 of side project. Meditation, studying, yoga, calisthenics are
all on the mind

Woke up at 730am, walked on treadmill for morning call from
8-9am. Walked Leche. Standup at 10am. Implemented "Add tracks".

Not a lot if you think about it. Inefficient maybe while I recover
with this neck tenseness.

Yoga after work. Intense. Hamstrings are tight. Impressive what the
instructor can do.

Sitting meditation in bed.

** Summary
Crossfade launch day today. 7am launch, stayed online till
noon. Deploy went smooth. A few patches to make it smoother.

Bee pollen day 1. No sinus attack but that might not be
related. Pinched nerve was loooooads better than yesterday. Tightened
up again after work / toward the end of the day. No pain medicine
though.

Leche pooped finally. She's on a new diet of chicken, rice and
vegetables while on an antibiotic. Several days of no poop. Pobrecita.

Mariana and I played soccer inside with a tennis ball and Leche played
all-time-goalie. She loved it.

Bed time.

Sinus attack today so I biked to Sprouts for bee pollen after biking
to the SC office for half the work day. Testing it out.

Meetings and launch prep today. Launching tomorrow morning at 7am.

Dance class with Mariana at 7pm. Scapula still hurts but getting
better with deep stretches. Some positions of sitting really
hurt. Hung on the bar and did assisted pullups several times. Still
pinchy but gotta work it out.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am for 730 call with Dad. Pinched nerve still here. Lying
on ground and stretching neck appears to help but then went to the
gym, rode bike for hour (low key) and read. Afterward, back to the
same tight neck pain.

Tried hanging upside down today but my shoulder mobility is severely
limited. That was kind of a wake-up call to do more deep
stretches. Wondering if sleeping on hard surface like I did when
camping will help. Focus on the spine and the neck's position.

Work was bug hunting from today's crossfade go/no-go call.

Last chapter of Solaris in bed. Thinking about calisthenics. Thinking
about giving an update to MBC audience about pausing.

** Summary
Drove to SLO and camped with Jered this weekend. Rained pretty hard so
we went to SLO to wait out the rain before hiking Bishops peak for a
bit. Went halfway up, I went a 20min up on my own then back. 10
condors (vultures?) flying. Worked up an appetite, went to Firestone
grill afterward.

Pinched a nerve under my left scapula. Not much relief with it so
hoping time and stretching heals it. Today, interviewed intern
candidate in last round. Next part of tracklist work.

What is it about travel that requires the change in routine. That can
be changed.

Reading in bed.

Long day. A number of fires that slowed dev work. New tires on the car
in the morning and picked up after work. Picked up Mariana after a
miscommunication whilst an outage was happening. On vacation for the
next few days.

Will read and unplug.

Focused on the tracklist hookup. Bigger refactor in the works. Cleaned
up the error page vector image for animation. Dance class at 7pm. Got
a flat and changed the tire with Mariana after. Benny's tacos for
dinner. Gas. Tomorrow morning I'll figure out where to get tires.

Woke up at 7am and made hot cacao. Quick bench press then leads
meeting. Walked to Rose market with Leche. Biked to office. Debugged
bug on staging. View only changes for tracklist.

Sinuses acted up a bit. Ordered bean and cheese from Benny's. It's not
made with care. Last time. Maybe with rice next time...probably not.

Biked home. Took Leche on a few walks, including to Mariana's
studio. Added some more designs to MBC. Have some product photography
I want to take after work tomorrow.

Dance class with Mariana tomorrow.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am. Restful sleep. Didn't record my dreams but two
"phases" of them. One before 6am and another from 6am-7am.

Saw the partial eclipse at 11am. Talked with neighbors whilst. Leche
bit some small hair off a sweet big dog. No bueno. The other dog was
okay but they got in a little tornado and Leche doesn't play it cool.

Worked on tracklist today. Some designs for MBC later. Worked in
sunshine for a bit. Amazing.

Fasted until lunch. Ate too much. Caffeine to recover but overshot it.

Reading Solaris in bed.

** Summary

Ran half marathon at "Finish the Run 2024" this weekend. Felt amazing
afterward. Seriously for like 3 hours after, felt super
high/euphoric. Not like drugs, like pure/unadultered focus. Like all
cobwebs were removed and I was bathed in joy. Sounds silly to write. I
wasn't manic or uncontrolled, just "extremely content".

Went to breakfast afterward and high started to fade a bit. Maybe from
the indulgent eating throughout the day, maybe just from time. Still,
mostly clean eating until the evening when I returned to leftover
pizza.

Watched "Legend" this weekend. What fun. Great costume design, simple
story. I loved the whole thing. Great fantasy story. Tim Curry's
performance was spot on.

Sunday, woke up and continued reading "Solaris" with some hot
cacao. Mariana went to her kickball game, I read outside in the sun. I
fasted until sundown, then broke it with a lemon salad with pickled
cabbage. Had some electrolyte drink throughout the day. Synthetic.

Recorded more tiktok videos, this time in a format copying david
lynch's "lucky number" videos. Was surprised to see as many likes as
it got. Will continue testing that. It could be tiktok internally
boosting it because I hadn't posted in a while though. Lower effort
than previous videos.

Played lots of "FLUX" with Mariana this weekend. We went to grocery
store together just now.

This week, we start a new sprint and likely more of the "multi-track
upload" flows, though that CDN and testing tickets should be thought
out more. We'll also finalize which interns make it to the next stage.

Going to read in bed. Solaris hooks you from the first few pages. End
of first chapter especially.

Tomorrow is a total solare eclipse. We will plan better for the next
one. Loved the first one we saw in Oregon. Alex and Mona will love it.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am, stretched. Made matcha then walked on treadmill for
arch meeting. Shared quick pitch for Rive then later demo'd to
designers. Interviewed two intern candidates.

First dance classes with Mariana today. Fun. Lot's to remember but
most importantly (for now) is posture.

Bed time.

** Summary

Went for a short run at 6am. Meetings from 7am-10am. Biked to office
after standup. Two intern interviews. One didn't show. Put up
animation comparison PR. Hope we go with Rive if only it means I get
to familiarize myself with that tool more.

After work I started farting around with figma and drafting ideas for
how we could animate a intern progress over 10 weeks idea. Good to
scope if this is realistic given other goals. Circle up a hill?
Animated badges with outlined SC logo?

Mind is racing with the thrill of animation and design ideas. It's
like being in a candy store, or hearing great music for the first time
even though my skills to play at that level aren't there at
all. Humbling and exhilarating.

** Summary

Woke at 7am. Made hot cacao and prepared for the day. Fasted until
5pm. Interviewed two intern candidates. Added more tests to dropzone
branch. Arbitrarily complex. If it's hard to write tests, we aren't
writing our code in an organized way. Some parts could use this
attention.

Wrote my last book reviews from the L&D summary.

Running tomorrow and Thursday before the big run this weekend.

** Summary
Weekend flew by. Friday, woke up early and went on a 4 mile run before
playing pickleball with coworkers. Jonathan cancelled so it was just
me, Tommy and his wife. We only got one game in before paddle tennis
old fart starting throwing nonsense around and bullied us off the
court. Real nasty. Whole lot of pretty entitled for a shared space.

Saturday was sick from that run. Sinus infection or whatever happens
after long runs. How to train against that? Maybe run with more
explicit nose breathing? Stayed inside. It rained.

Caught up on sleep for Sunday. Arie, Erie and Eric's dog, is staying
with us this weekend. She's more anxious than usual.

Finished "The Creative Act". Enjoyed a lot of it. Also enjoyed the
focused space to rest. Archived my notes for "How to live"

Fasted today and broke it around 5pm. Felt great all day. Broke it
with a grapefruit, then orange, then almonds, then cashews, then soup.

Tomorrow, will interview a few candidates for the internship.

Going to bed.

** Summary
Somethings aren't worth the attention. Many things maybe. Tail wagging
the dog.

Short run this morning at 645am. Too much light in the day.

Biked to work and focused on the dropzone refactor. Looking good but
more refactoring to come. Beautiful code is a temptation. Requires the
team thinking in beautiful code. Think about tools for
this. Distributed team.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am. 8am "catch up" call. Sprint planning at 10am. Walked
Leche after. Sat in sun and meditated during lunch. Two matchas in the
morning and yerba mate in the afternoon to study the dropzone
refactor. Still hairy.

Pasta dinner. Not good. Rice and beans is better, nutritious meal.

Running tomorrow then /now page.

** Summary
Woke up and bug bashed with Moritz. Biked to office. Fixie is weird,
too much tought required and i'm not interested in that project right
now. New airless tire is great though. Plan was to have lunch with
Mariana at office but Marie is in town and she had lunch with her.

Came home, took Leche to anawalt to get fungicide. Why? Why waste time
and money on it? Patience and effort would have done just as good. I
learned a bit from talking with the store rep but not much. Learned
that other shoppers were just as squirely in their questions.

Ordered pizza for dinner and watched a movie. Mariana chose "Napolean
Dynomight" because she hadn't seen it. I tuned out and frankly so did
she. I told her I always thought it was only a "meme movie". A cult
phenom, with some jokes but mostly over the top.

Going to bed. Running half marathon in the morning again. Deep
stretches this time.

** Summary
Woke up at 545 and was running by 615 after deep stretch and
electrolytes. Solid run with no side pain. 8am-11am meetings, walked
on treadmill. Returned to multi-track work.

Airless tire arrived today. Installed it after work. Installed bike as
fixie to try that out. Rode it around the street, didn't like it very
much but will give it a try tomorrow. Dinner of curry lentils and
rice. Delicious.

Rhinitis after this morning's run. Reddit users say after consistent
running, it'll go away. Mayo clinic says to breathe through nose while
running or warm up the nasal cavity first. I'll do that tomorrow
morning during deep stretch.

Having lunch with Mariana at the SC office tomorrow.

Bedtime. In order to stop this nose running.

** Summary
Great energy today after morning run. Deep stretch and electrolytes
before run, no hip side pain.

Worked on e2e tests. Made rice and beans for dinner. Attention starts
to get fuzzy and scattered after the long work day.

Didn't overeat at lunch and kept two caffeine drinks (matcha, in the
morning). Also aided with the energy.

Leche worked from Mariana's office too so maybe that had something to
do with the focus. Maybe not.

Bedtime.

** Summary

Woke up at 7am. Deep rest after long drive. How can I make the trip
there and back without feeling drained? More exercise? More
stretching? Finishing the unpack/chores before bed? Writing the game
plan on travel day so it's not just "head back to LA"?

Anyway, no morning meeting but I was online by 8am. Pagerduty alerts
need to be tuned. Only keep the capacity ones IMO.

Finished the "code org" ticket. Chat with Tommy. Hitting the backlog
tomorrow.

After work: did workout, made dinner, made sauerkraut, measured bike
tires and ordered airless ones, household supplies from amazon, baked
sweet potatoes for the week. Mended socks while Mariana watched
TV. Folded laundry.

Lot's of little stuff piles up. Keep having fun with MBC
videos. Excited to read something fun after these mindset books.

** Summary

In TJ this weekend. Left on Thursday night at 7pm, in town by
10pm. Went to a futbol game on Friday with Maru, Mariana, Leo and his
friend. Made a poor decision and ate mac & cheese, grilled cheese
there. Paid for it the next morning. Dumb.

Had great lunch at Vegan place before then. Saturday was chill. Ran in
the morning, then drove downtown for breakfast with Mariana and for
her to pick up a new retainer.

Meditated on conversation most of the day.

Family came over for lengua dinner Maru made. I didn't eat for two
reasons: I don't eat meat and I was still full from late lunch of my
dish and some of Mariana's.

Maru was kind and offered to make fried cheese dinner. I have
definitely fallen off my health goals on many fronts. I could and
should have packed some grains and beans I could eat. I don't have a
real goal in mind other than "eat when I'm hungry and eat nutritious
foods that I'm lacking". Often, not practicing that goal as the Friday
futbol game and fried cheese dinner demonstrate. No biggie, something
to keep in mind for improving.

I forget how therapuetic writing is. Brings order to thoughts. Just
dump it all on the page and delete or PRIVATE-ize it. Feel some
clearer vision about MBC.

Not sure what I'll do after the half-marathon. It's more of a time
commitment than 5x5, less than bouldering. Running 4 miles in ~40min,
several times per week vs lifting 5x5 3.5 times per week at
40min. Pretty even, except running requires one BIG run every
weekend. Those mornings could be spent on MBC, but I don't have a "big
thing" to do for the project in place of running. Perhaps filming lots
more videos or getting the v1 website up. Do the videos then do the
website.

Heading back to LA today.

Left for LA around 2pm, home around 5:30pm. Traffic and additional
delay since border entry line was way further south this
time. Strange. Also the first time I've seen USA's border side staffed
on entry into Mexico.

Came home, Mariana went to see Pau and Remi real quick. I went grocery
shopping after. Bed time.

Good, solid rest last night. Woke up at 6:45, bathroom, tea and at
computer with thoughts by 7:20am.

Thinking about personal accountability this morning. Why I stopped the
"fun websites" rhythm and how to produce the MBC tiktok videos
efficiently (once per month)

Job description for internship is due on Friday. Focused work day at
office. Biked home but got a flat tire. Now's the time to replace them
with solid rubber wheels.

some flow when I stood at desk with binaural white noise.

** Summary

Dad and Alex stayed yesterday. Made bimbibap for dinner and played
Catan. Really fun. Dad's first time playing and lots of belly
laughs. Woke up at 630 and made coffee for Dad when he woke up later.

Found the videos I want to make for this month. Filmed 3. Filming them
all in one day will give lots more leverage. Good idea to do "the one
thing" exercise again but with the focus of "fun". Then another for
"quality product" or "portfolio product".

It would probably take a full day to record the month's videos.

Going to bed. Running the half marathon tomorrow. I suspect, 3 hours
in total given that I may need to walk some of that 4 mile uphill.

** Summary
Woke up at 6am and focused on side project. Not strictly "the one
thing" exercise but instead, started a list of artists to make content
for based on:

- if they have a good song
- less than ~1K followers
- have engaged recently

Still, "the one thing" exercise is important because six months will
fly by. Reverse engineer goal session.

8am call with team. Added more system alarms. After work, did a quick
lifting session.

Mailing Victory Kid's buttons tomorrow. Dad and Alex driving down
tomorrow. Having bimbibap at home and maybe a board game.

Bed.

** Summary
My /now focus for the month of February was to grow a tiktok audience
for my DTC project. Here are some stats:

I posted 19 videos related to the nice, 17 of which were @-mentioning
people within the niche as a growth strategy.

Of these 17, 15 were for strangers ("warmed the cache" by creating
content for some friends). Of those 15, 6 followed me back. One
followed before I posted a video of them. This is the ideal state:
musicians following me in hopes of a video being made.

Of the 6 who followed back, 5 were super active on tiktok (recent
posts and or comments) and had an average number of followers less
than 1K.

That's the sweet before posting more videos. They should:

1. Make a good song recently that they're trying to promote
2. Have less than 1K followers (unless I have a really clever video idea)
3. Have posted within the last week

TODO:
- look for hashtags and sounds at ads.tiktok.com
- record all the videos on the same day
- schedule content

---------------

Woke up at 6am and ran a short 1.5 miles. After work, lots of small tasks since
chore routines off from vacation. During work, setup some alerting.

Retro of tiktok videos suggests I should keep doing it so long as its
not the only thing I do to grow the idea. Running through "The One
Thing" plan seems fruitful if it guides my focus. Tomorrow, I'll skip
going on a run and work on this before work.

** Summary
Woke up and ran 6 miles before work. New route. Around the park and up
and back exposition. Fun but not long enough. Maybe two laps around
the park and down exposition and back next time.

Still on the minification problem. Thinking I have a solution that
might work for community too. Annoying that it's a ghost.

Had a massage at the office as part of employee apreciation
week. Awesome. Grateful for that. Aproval for internship, will draft
the system tomorrow.

Bed time.

** Summary

Good day. Didn't run today, rested. Been a few days since I've done a
big run or any rigorous exercise. Errands all day. Finished MBC
costume, preped materials for MBC content, cleaned kitchen, took Leche
on a longer walk and played outside with her.

Grocery store then basic meal prep for the week. Cleaned
kitchen. Cleaning the stove goes a long way. Did laundry. Sneakers are
getting pretty dirty, not worth the mental energy. Ride them to the
ground.

** Summary
Woke up and still raining so delayed my morning run. Forcast is dry
for tomorrow. Presented the "concise pull requests" speech today. My
cadence wasn't as good as it was last week when I was supposed to
present but oh well.

Interviewed FE candidate and responded to Pablo's comments.

Have all the materials for the MBC costume. Once made, the content
rhythm changes.

Three day weekend. Woke up at 5 and by 545 went on 5mi run. Came home
then biked to padel tennis courts to play some games with David. Biked
home. Made MBC materials for the week. Posted. More Rive
tutorial. Fixed one small style issue on site.

Mariana back from TJ. She's still sick. Starting to rain lots. I have
to prepare presentation for Tuesday tomorrow; will look for quiet for
that.

** Summary

Woke up at 5am, on the road running by 6am. Tiktok scrolling. Run was
good, tight hips on mile 2 but not as bad as before. Investigated the
crossfade router issue. The problem was only half captured in the
ticket, need a more sophisticated solution. Make sure it doesn't
overlap with others work.

Interviewed eng candidate.

MBC post at lunch. Pasta Sisters for dinner.

Bed time.

** Summary
Woke up today and was sneezy/congested until lunch when I went outside
and got in the sun. Still congested after that but not nearly as bad.

Its basically the same attack I had two weeks ago when I planted fava
beans on Jan 24. Back then I thought it was because I did it in the
cold with shorts and no socks in the cold dirt. Maybe I caught a cold
last night. Wore those shorts but not undies, sweater and socks to
bed. Maybe it's cold.

** Summary

Woke up and ran by 6am. Roads and sidewalks were a bit wet but not too
bad. Claudia joined the side project and I made her items after work.

Four hygienic PRs at SC today. One refactoring I'd like to do before
EOW as it relates to the upload work.

Have an idea for daily rhythm of MBC. Will start that in the morning.

Mailers come tomorrow. Need other packaging and to confirm stamps /
rates. A few sessions building spreadsheet would be good too.

Bed.

** Summary
First sunny day since the storm started this weekend. Reviewed code
and wrote some tests. Posted MBC content and wrote down some
ideas. Need to prototype the "music video" idea if i can re-use them.

Played with Leche, she pooped thrice.

Hoping to work on e2e tests tomorrow but yield to the team

Going to prototype MBC a bit before sleep.

** Summary
Went for 4mile run Saturday morning. Played pickleball at the public
courts for three (maybe four?) hours before coming home to watch
LOTR. Watched part two and three on Sunday during the storm.

Went to Ralphs to get that tart Mariana got when we visited Marcella
and Omar. It's a tasty sugar bomb. Felt great after that hike but not
as much when we sat and watched movies all day.

I'm waiting for TikTok to verify my account so I can start
posting...as I type this, I realize I can still make progress: work on
the friggen videos you goof. Post them once you have a link ready. You
can post them in the other networks too. Silly.

** Summary

Pretty good day energy-wise. Soured a bit in the evening.

The rushed anxiety of being done with work, delivery food and the
hurried "let's pick a movie" left me with a terrible feeling. Like
witnessing no discipline and a spoiled child weighing on a tired
parent. Not a good feeling so I took pause to reflect.

Later we watched The Color Purple (the original). It's a well made
story, captivates you for the duration. Oprah looks much
different. Whoopi Goldberg was charming.

Didn't run today for the grounds we still wet and I gave myself that
excuse. I should try it though, running in the rain. Can't be that
bad. Meditation before bed.

** Summary
Broke the fast this morning at 6:30am. With hot cacao and tea. Two
hours later with a bean pancake, lettuce and sauerkraut. Delicious.

Walked Leche, worked from home and re-submitted PR after chasing down
bug I added in PR. Fixed it an resubmitted. A few interrupts after
sharing a dream to animate the design logo.

Food went nearly straight through me all day. Energy was pretty good
though, no sugar crashes but not as "keto-focused" as yesterday
obviously. Also, I felt frustrated that the PR task took as long as it
did.

Made mac n cheese with broccoli for dinner. Rushed to refill our water
before they closed after. Wrote notes on "How to win friends &
influence people". "One Thing" is the next book but only in my down
time. This next month's goal is to focus on getting better content on
tiktok in my side-projects niche. In the morning, I can start similar
creators in my niche. What were their successful posts? How many posts
do they have? What do they charge? What is their minimum unit cost?
Shipping guarantees? Are they creative?

** Summary
Woke up at 5am and went for a 4mile run by 5:30am. Felt great. Fasted
all day. Will break it tomorrow.

Proposed solution for single task queue. Worked from office. At lunch,
biked to USPS and mailed MBC buttons. Went to farmers market for honey
after.

Bike home, walked Mariana to her studio. Back, went to dog store for
Leche food, 99c store to see if they had good organic food (they
didn't) and then sprouts for groceries. Dishes and trash when home,
baked sweet potatoes for tomorrow. Wasted time online while Mariana
went to gym. Wrote this. Falling asleep now

** Summary
Not a focused day. Started the day with meetings and stayed unfocused
after that. Lower back and knees hurt a lot. Going on a big run
tomorrow morning.

What if all meetings were only 5minutes. No "break outs", big fat
timer shown on every one's screen, forcing people to be terse with
their words. Game theory though, it's some peoples job to get people
in rooms talking and that's a loose success metric. Noodling on this.

Bed.

** Summary
Yesterday, we drove to Santa Barbara to meet Lazaro. Big boy. Likes to
cry right now. We brought chinese food and a cake. Walked to the beach
and back before driving home. Omar popped the yoga ball while bouncing
Lazaro to sleep.

Today, played pickleball for a few hours in the afternoon. Got lunch at that
french bakery on Pico before going to Anawalt lumber for soil and a
new house plant. We got two bags of soil. Came home and repotted many
of our house plants with new soil. Afterward, Mariana went to the gym
and I transplanted some outdoor plants. The pionsettias I found a few
weeks ago are in the front now. Repotted one of the sapote too.

Pickleball was fun. Played four games. Shirt off all day to catch the
sun. Felt great.

In the evening I disassembeled the apple keyboard I got on craigslist
nd deep cleaned it. The action is a lot harder than the mechanical
keyboard but if its consistent, I won't mind.

Laundry folding before bed.

This week, go/no-go on Mazatlan trip. Tiktok ad for MBC, mail,
re-design intro based on jitter.video's onboard (focused).

* 01/26/2024
** Summary
Fridays are great because there is mostly no plan. Just code.

Woke up and ran by 6:30am. Short 2mi run around Rose. Picked up
keyboard for desktop then dropped off UPS package. Took Leche for a
walk and made her an egg. Biked to work and was pretty focused.

Biked home and had conveyour belt sushi with Mariana. Ate really

** Summary
Rainy day, everything was slowed down because of it. Didn't run in the
early morning because it was torential and I don't have a rain
jacket. Did 2mi on the walking treadmill later in the day.

Focus.

Pushups a few times. Researched the multiupload problem.

Moved the cactus I rescued up to the edge of the yard. Will plant fava
beans in small section in a few days and in a two weeks as a test.

Reading, meditation before bed.

** Summary
Mariana didn't want to drive or possibly camp in the rain so we
cancelled the camp trip that morning. Didn't let it phase me, enjoyed
the weekend at home and read. Washed Leche, made a soup, watched a
pretty pandering movie ("Men" by Alex Garland). I enjoyed Garland's Ex
Machina but not this one. Felt too long. Good performance from the
character actor.

Reading "How to Win Friends and Influence people" and am thoroughly
enjoying it. It's prescriptive but focused. 20 or so chapters each
with a principle to focus your attention.

Spoke with Joey last night. Happy for the path he's chosen and the
focus he's setting for himself. Not preaching or judging but want to
encourage health and wealth in all my friends and family.

Bed time.

** Summary
Woke up at 6:30 and ran by 7am. Back and took Leche for walk. Got
Mariana and croissant before returning Leche to her. She spent the day
with Mariana at work. I worked from SC office which was pretty
quiet. We merged the memory leak fix and the upload refactor.

Going to bed. Laundry tomorrow morning before packing the car for
camping. Fasting tomorrow as I overate processed foods today. All
processed fake meat foods. I've slipped from WFPB to lazy vegan. One
was incredibly focused and the other...lazy. Thinking about the food
goal this year. Sweet potatoes I think.

** Summary

Woke up at 6:30 and running by 7am. Intentionally ran a bit faster on
the last leg. Not concerned about timing yet but would be great if my
"unconscious pace" were faster.

Spent the whole day on the memory leak problem. Cornered it but
haven't squashed it. Will spend more time with Josh and team.

Went to Mitsuwa for dinner with Mariana. Threw the ball with Leche
before work. Poor girl was pretty bored all day. Didn't take a break
from computer / bug hunting.

Camping this weekend. Looking forward to it. Will finish the book and
might start the next one.

Reading then bed.

** Summary

Weekend flew by. Saturday we played pickleball, got smoothies,
showered, went over to Pau and David's until the evening. Met
Remi. She looks like David. We played "Guess Who" but with a variant
of David's: "politically incorrect questions only"

Sunday Mariana went to her old coworker's (Aubrey?) birthday party. I
went to grocery store and picked up baked goods for her. Ran, played
with Leche, made big batch of saurkraut (3 heads). If I make it any
bigger next time, I'll use my feet in the tamales pot.

Had today off for MLK day. Woke up refreshed at 5:30am and was on my
run by 6am. Up the hill on Rose st again. Anxious energy most of the
day. Maybe because I got an early but then didn't really do anything
for several hours. My first committed task was at 11am when I decided
to continue reading "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin.

Focused afterward. Overall felt like I put too much on my plate. Has
happened several times before on holiday days. How can I get better?

Did some bench press and took Leche on a long walk up the hill to get
the blood flowing. Did most of the small tasks on my /now list. I
should keep this more high level and keep task lists as a means for
these small items.

Prepared some of the DTC demo. After tomorrow morning's run, will
prepare some more.

Going to bed after reading more.

Good day. Ran at 6am before sun. Pickleball with Pablo. Four
games. Lots of tasks that have been nagging me at work. Clear
plate. Good Indian food for lunch, ate it with the team back at the
office. Maybe 200 pushups throughout the day? During my 5min breaks
while focusing. Biked home, then drove to pick up Mariana's gift
(pickleball jerseys).

Went to mall to fix apple tv. Needed to reset IR remote (press home
and volume down). Had food court food first. Came home. TV remote came
in, replaced it.

Going to read before bed.

Woke up at 630 and went for run. In office by 10 and back home to wfh
by 2pm. Nearly finished the day's work. Office with so many meetings
is not productive. Build, review, merge. If we cut our meeting times
in half, I bet we'd still get the same performance.

Went to dinner (vegan place) with Mariana. Going to read before
bed. Running in the morning then playing pickleball with Pablo and

** Summary
Woke up and ran at 7am. Call at 8am then office with Leche at
10am. Returned home at noon.

I won't waste time on unnecessary work meetings anymore.
I will split my focus or leave the meeting if it's not important.

Digestion bad after a strange mix of food. Banana, hemp, oatmilk
smoothy for late snack then tofu, peas, kimchi and rice for dinner an
hour or so later. Farting all night.

Need to book hipcamp, hoping camp host replies tomorrow.

Best habits in myself. Find calm and stretch before bed.

Sleep.

** Summary
Good day. Woke up at 6am and went for run up the hill on Rose
ave. 1.5mi there and back. Good to get some grading training in. The
half marathon looks like a 7% grade if its like years before. That
hill is 6%. Good start.

Lots of coworkers flew out to LA this week so I'm working from office
each day. Nice.

Leche had her teeth cleaned today. Next time I'll do it myself. Good
to get the baseline. It's called "scaling" your dogs teeth.

** Summary
Back in LA after weekend in TJ. Woke up for a run at 8am then went to
Baristi. The house was still asleep when I got back so I made tea and
read outside. Very windy but sunny. Had breakfast with Mariana and
Maru. Religion, culture and identity came up. Good discussion.

Disassembled Christmas tree and packaged it. On the road to LA by 3:30
or so. Home by 7pm because of some construction traffic in TJ. Once
the Sun set, I needed some caffeine to stay awake at the wheel. More
food coma from the three border burritos I ate than
tiredness. Overshot it with half a canned yerba mate (14g sugar, 75mg
of caffeine from mixed sources). Chemical concoction. I'm WIRED.

Did laundry, made eggs for Leche and I. Mariana took a Rosca to
Paulina and David.

Going to try to sleep now.

Tomorrow morning: run, finish annual report, create letters for
friends and family, plan the week (Tuesday pick up special gift).

** Summary

Woke up at 5:10 but out of bed at 5:40am. Vivid dreams. Went for a run
and saw uprooted tree still on ground so drove back and got it. After
work, I potted it. Moved some soil from the front to the pot and mixed
perlite. Rooting agent brushed onto the base before burying. We'll see.

Got more polish on my side project done before work. Will start
sending friends the idea by EOM.

Design feedback on upload at SC. Drove to TJ at 7pm after picking up
Leche dog food then Mariana Panda Express. ATM and gas on the way
down. In TJ by 10pm (ish). Going to bed now, will read some of the
communication book. Running in the morning.

Good day. Rained hard last night so no early morning run. Did a short

Found solution to the 404 problem.

Side project looks good. Will run tests the morning.

** Summary
Woke up at 5:50am and went for a 1.5mi run. Felt great. Deployed side
project before SC work at 8am. Booked half marathon for April 6th in LA.

Looking into options for total solar eclipse. Mazatlan direct is super
expensive but the benefit is we have a place to stay...might balance
out. Costs $4k if direct. Unless we leave on Sunday night and return
on Monday night (only $500)

SC work was focused.

One of my biggest goals this year has to be around my attention. If I
don't have something to do, I tend to get sucked into mindless
wandering or scrolling. It might serve an unconsciously healthy
purpose but it gets to the point of habit and it bothers me.

Bed time.

** Summary
New Years party at Setareh and Mehdi's house. Stayed until 1am or so,
back by 1:45am. Woke up around 9:30/10am. Vivid dreams but my
recording of them has fallen off. Pen next to bed

Lots of small chores today. Ran 1.5 loops around the block with
Leche. Skimmed mold off saurkraut, finance review for December and all
of 2024. Topped off oil. Made split pea soup and bagguettes. Short
workout after the run with Leche. Laundry.

Some side project planning but it feels fake/forced. Maybe it's just a
weak muscle. Short plan, execute. Short plan, execute. 6 weeks? 2 weeks?

While throwing the ball with Leche today, she picked up some smell of
a bite to eat under Travis and Jessica's car. She ate it before I
could see what it was. Stuck my hand in her mouth to fish it out but
wasn't there. Gave her a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and 8oz of
water to flush it out. Had to force her to drink it which is no fun
but was for her own good. She threw up a bit at first then throw up
food about 5min later. Poor Leche. All the paranoia because a dog
(Cash) in our neighborhood died because he ate some rate poison he
found on the street. Terrible. Better safe than sorry.

We watched The Truman Show after dinner because Mariana hadn't seen
it. Discovered this while playing the board game "Dixit" at Setareh
and Mehdi's house last night. Solid movie, still fun to rewatch.

Bed time. Going to meditate before sleep.

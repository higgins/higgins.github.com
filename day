** Summary
Fridays are great because there is mostly no plan. Just code.

Woke up and ran by 6:30am. Short 2mi run around Rose. Picked up
keyboard for desktop then dropped off UPS package. Took Leche for a
walk and made her an egg. Biked to work and was pretty focused.

Biked home and had conveyour belt sushi with Mariana. Ate really
fast. Came home, going to bed after reading.

** Summary
Rainy day, everything was slowed down because of it. Didn't run in the
early morning because it was torential and I don't have a rain
jacket. Did 2mi on the walking treadmill later in the day.

Focus.

Pushups a few times. Researched the multiupload problem.

Moved the cactus I rescued up to the edge of the yard. Will plant fava
beans in small section in a few days and in a two weeks as a test.

Reading, meditation before bed.

** Summary
Mariana didn't want to drive or possibly camp in the rain so we
cancelled the camp trip that morning. Didn't let it phase me, enjoyed
the weekend at home and read. Washed Leche, made a soup, watched a
pretty pandering movie ("Men" by Alex Garland). I enjoyed Garland's Ex
Machina but not this one. Felt too long. Good performance from the
character actor.

Reading "How to Win Friends and Influence people" and am thoroughly
enjoying it. It's prescriptive but focused. 20 or so chapters each
with a principle to focus your attention.

Spoke with Joey last night. Happy for the path he's chosen and the
focus he's setting for himself. Not preaching or judging but want to
encourage health and wealth in all my friends and family.

Bed time.

** Summary
Woke up at 6:30 and ran by 7am. Back and took Leche for walk. Got
Mariana and croissant before returning Leche to her. She spent the day
with Mariana at work. I worked from SC office which was pretty
quiet. We merged the memory leak fix and the upload refactor.

Going to bed. Laundry tomorrow morning before packing the car for
camping. Fasting tomorrow as I overate processed foods today. All
processed fake meat foods. I've slipped from WFPB to lazy vegan. One
was incredibly focused and the other...lazy. Thinking about the food
goal this year. Sweet potatoes I think.

** Summary

Woke up at 6:30 and running by 7am. Intentionally ran a bit faster on
the last leg. Not concerned about timing yet but would be great if my
"unconscious pace" were faster.

Spent the whole day on the memory leak problem. Cornered it but
haven't squashed it. Will spend more time with Josh and team.

Went to Mitsuwa for dinner with Mariana. Threw the ball with Leche
before work. Poor girl was pretty bored all day. Didn't take a break
from computer / bug hunting.

Camping this weekend. Looking forward to it. Will finish the book and
might start the next one.

Reading then bed.

** Summary

Weekend flew by. Saturday we played pickleball, got smoothies,
showered, went over to Pau and David's until the evening. Met
Remi. She looks like David. We played "Guess Who" but with a variant
of David's: "politically incorrect questions only"

Sunday Mariana went to her old coworker's (Aubrey?) birthday party. I
went to grocery store and picked up baked goods for her. Ran, played
with Leche, made big batch of saurkraut (3 heads). If I make it any
bigger next time, I'll use my feet in the tamales pot.

Had today off for MLK day. Woke up refreshed at 5:30am and was on my
run by 6am. Up the hill on Rose st again. Anxious energy most of the
day. Maybe because I got an early but then didn't really do anything
for several hours. My first committed task was at 11am when I decided
to continue reading "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin.

Focused afterward. Overall felt like I put too much on my plate. Has
happened several times before on holiday days. How can I get better?

Did some bench press and took Leche on a long walk up the hill to get
the blood flowing. Did most of the small tasks on my /now list. I
should keep this more high level and keep task lists as a means for
these small items.

Prepared some of the DTC demo. After tomorrow morning's run, will
prepare some more.

Going to bed after reading more.

** Summary

Good day. Ran at 6am before sun. Pickleball with Pablo. Four
games. Lots of tasks that have been nagging me at work. Clear
plate. Good Indian food for lunch, ate it with the team back at the
office. Maybe 200 pushups throughout the day? During my 5min breaks
while focusing. Biked home, then drove to pick up Mariana's gift
(pickleball jerseys).

Went to mall to fix apple tv. Needed to reset IR remote (press home
and volume down). Had food court food first. Came home. TV remote came
in, replaced it.

Going to read before bed.

by 2pm. Nearly finished the day's work. Office with so many meetings
is not productive. Build, review, merge. If we cut our meeting times
in half, I bet we'd still get the same performance.

Went to dinner (vegan place) with Mariana. Going to read before
bed. Running in the morning then playing pickleball with Pablo and
Josh and maybe other coworkers.

** Summary
Woke up and ran at 7am. Call at 8am then office with Leche at
10am. Returned home at noon.

I won't waste time on unnecessary work meetings anymore.
I will split my focus or leave the meeting if it's not important.

Digestion bad after a strange mix of food. Banana, hemp, oatmilk
smoothy for late snack then tofu, peas, kimchi and rice for dinner an
hour or so later. Farting all night.

Need to book hipcamp, hoping camp host replies tomorrow.

Best habits in myself. Find calm and stretch before bed.

Sleep.

** Summary
Good day. Woke up at 6am and went for run up the hill on Rose
ave. 1.5mi there and back. Good to get some grading training in. The
half marathon looks like a 7% grade if its like years before. That
hill is 6%. Good start.

Lots of coworkers flew out to LA this week so I'm working from office
each day. Nice.

Leche had her teeth cleaned today. Next time I'll do it myself. Good
to get the baseline. It's called "scaling" your dogs teeth.

** Summary
Back in LA after weekend in TJ. Woke up for a run at 8am then went to
Baristi. The house was still asleep when I got back so I made tea and
read outside. Very windy but sunny. Had breakfast with Mariana and
Maru. Religion, culture and identity came up. Good discussion.

Disassembled Christmas tree and packaged it. On the road to LA by 3:30
or so. Home by 7pm because of some construction traffic in TJ. Once
the Sun set, I needed some caffeine to stay awake at the wheel. More
food coma from the three border burritos I ate than
tiredness. Overshot it with half a canned yerba mate (14g sugar, 75mg
of caffeine from mixed sources). Chemical concoction. I'm WIRED.

Did laundry, made eggs for Leche and I. Mariana took a Rosca to
Paulina and David.

Going to try to sleep now.

Tomorrow morning: run, finish annual report, create letters for
friends and family, plan the week (Tuesday pick up special gift).

** Summary

Woke up at 5:10 but out of bed at 5:40am. Vivid dreams. Went for a run
and saw uprooted tree still on ground so drove back and got it. After
work, I potted it. Moved some soil from the front to the pot and mixed
perlite. Rooting agent brushed onto the base before burying. We'll see.

Got more polish on my side project done before work. Will start
sending friends the idea by EOM.

Design feedback on upload at SC. Drove to TJ at 7pm after picking up
Leche dog food then Mariana Panda Express. ATM and gas on the way
down. In TJ by 10pm (ish). Going to bed now, will read some of the
communication book. Running in the morning.

** Summary
Good day. Rained hard last night so no early morning run. Did a short
one (0.6mi) with Leche around the block.

Attention divided after work but good energy today. Walked 3mi.

Found solution to the 404 problem.

Side project looks good. Will run tests the morning.

** Summary
Woke up at 5:50am and went for a 1.5mi run. Felt great. Deployed side
project before SC work at 8am. Booked half marathon for April 6th in LA.

Looking into options for total solar eclipse. Mazatlan direct is super
expensive but the benefit is we have a place to stay...might balance
out. Costs $4k if direct. Unless we leave on Sunday night and return
on Monday night (only $500)

SC work was focused.

One of my biggest goals this year has to be around my attention. If I
don't have something to do, I tend to get sucked into mindless
wandering or scrolling. It might serve an unconsciously healthy
purpose but it gets to the point of habit and it bothers me.

Bed time.

** Summary
New Years party at Setareh and Mehdi's house. Stayed until 1am or so,
back by 1:45am. Woke up around 9:30/10am. Vivid dreams but my
recording of them has fallen off. Pen next to bed

Lots of small chores today. Ran 1.5 loops around the block with
Leche. Skimmed mold off saurkraut, finance review for December and all
of 2024. Topped off oil. Made split pea soup and bagguettes. Short
workout after the run with Leche. Laundry.

Some side project planning but it feels fake/forced. Maybe it's just a
weak muscle. Short plan, execute. Short plan, execute. 6 weeks? 2 weeks?

While throwing the ball with Leche today, she picked up some smell of
a bite to eat under Travis and Jessica's car. She ate it before I
could see what it was. Stuck my hand in her mouth to fish it out but
wasn't there. Gave her a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and 8oz of
water to flush it out. Had to force her to drink it which is no fun
but was for her own good. She threw up a bit at first then throw up
food about 5min later. Poor Leche. All the paranoia because a dog
(Cash) in our neighborhood died because he ate some rate poison he
found on the street. Terrible. Better safe than sorry.

We watched The Truman Show after dinner because Mariana hadn't seen
it. Discovered this while playing the board game "Dixit" at Setareh
and Mehdi's house last night. Solid movie, still fun to rewatch.

Bed time. Going to meditate before sleep.

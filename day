** Summary
Made 50 videos and started cold emailing prospects. Didn't email them
all, will do that in the morning.

Heatwave is intense. AC running often. Lots of caffeine this
weekend. Had yerba mate late at night and now can't sleep. Eating
nuts, eggs and avocado now. Going to watch a movie and hope to sleep
within the hour.


* 09/07/2024
** Summary
Good day. Created product for cold emails, recorded 3 pitch videos and
1 quick tiktok trend

Talked with Dad at noon and had some good flowing energy.

Played with Leche and walked for a bit but it was dang hot.

Bed. Recording the 50 videos tomorrow morning.

** Summary
Great day. Flowing with that new Jon Hopkins album (Ritual). Hit
backlog ticket. After work, made some promo videos to mail out.

Great focus. Yesterday's workout probably helped. Used Peets coffee in
the morning, then matcha smoothie for lunch, then green tea with
dinner.

** Summary
Fixed the SC bug. Posted new MBC after work. Needed to sweat after
work to get the juices flowing. Rough day in that regard. Running
again can help. Especially if there is a goal/target.

Also pitched Channel 5 again. Will do several more until I get a
response.

Hospitality and conferences tomorrow.

Back from vacation and day was busy. No MBC work because I got the
house in order after work, namely: laundry, cleaned kitchen and part
of bathroom, transplanted ginkgo, some basic meal prep (cut fruit and
veg)

One man show right now and it's not focused. I can't take any more
weekend trips before vacation. Mariana will go to TJ this weekend then
all of September I'll cold call and hit our SC deadlines.

Stay focused.

** Summary
Drove up to Berkeley on Friday and back down on Monday (Labor
day). Hung out with Jered and Jacqueline all weekend, it was
great. Tacos on Friday then board game at airbnb. Cafe then Point
Reyes, beach day, then oysters on Saturday. Sunday in San Francisco at
GG park. Slack-lined, played Hanabi and Barry and her dog hung out
with us. Drove back to Oakland before this dim sum placed closed. Ate
at airbnb. Drove to Marin to have breakfast with Andrew and Nuria
before driving down.

Left at 12, got roast chicken for Leche then attempted to take "the
scenic route" down but I guess that means the 1 and not the 101. So
ate lunch in Foster City before taking was was still a nice route
down: 805 to 101 to 5 to 405.

** Summary

Arch talk. DEI talk. Standup. Walked Leche. Couldn't find bug but
found another. Pushups throughout day. Made MBC order through order
app. Need to do lifts again.

Instead of multiple conferences, focusing on one big one (Disrupt)
makes sense. Researching. After holiday, consumer app makes
sense. Maybe only when I have a real machine to build it on (new mbp)
so don't waste time on the idea. Focus on sales and outreach. If you
get 100 "no"s, then you can work on the next variant

Sleep.

** Summary
Back at SC. Tested a bug. Couldn't repro, found a refactor that might
be worth doing (famous last words).

We'll do our continuous deployment for webi starting October 1st. Will
outline tickets for team members and create e2e tests before then.

Cleaned out closet (mostly). Some mold on my boots (wtf). Will see if
cleaning is effective.

Side conversation this evening with Mariana about the effectiveness of
for-profit fentynol testing services vs city controlled ones. Look at
evidence before making conclusions.

Tomorrow morning, my goal is to get a list of all tech conferences in
North America before the end of year. Second goal is to find emails
for those conferences. Reach out to David about apollo access.

Third goal: wizardhead button.

** Summary

Announced MBC via tiktok and IG on Friday. Starting sales loop next
week: reach out to conferences. Need to figure out what (if any) band
rhythm continues on tiktok. Should be "fire and forget" content. Maybe
the "lucky song" is good enough.

We went to Santa Barbara this weekend to stay with Marcella and
Omar. Lazzaro is growing up nice. A bit of mamitis at the moment but
not especially noticable once he starts playing. Apps for tracking his
sleep and food is interesting. Good idea though I suspect I'll want to
ensure the foods it encourages are okay. Yes.

We went to SB beach on Saturday and the park on
Sunday. Slack-lined. Very fun.

Drove back late. Got home at 830; I'm wiped. Tiring driving with no
light.

Bed. Waking up early to start the engines.

** Summary

I can sleep early tonight. Provisional profile filed, inventory
arrived in Santa Cruz. Screwed up and didn't submit the app to app
store last night! I noticed at 4pm so I'm still waiting to see if
apple will pick it up tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

Good feedback so far. I think I should store history of changes.

Fixed two bugs at SC.

Bed now, asleep before 11.

* 08/21/2024
** Summary
Went to bed at 3am. Fixed open issue at SC. Biked to office for lunch
and to work there for a bit. My 1 year work anniversary was
today. They gave me this little vinyl coaster

After work, filed for a provisional patent on my idea. Cutover
production site. Discovered ios darkmode issue thanks to Jered and
Jacqueline testing. Deployed the fix for apple to review by 2am (for
both android and ios). Will be great when i get new computer. Can do
all my building on one device instead of juggling my two ancient work
machines. Actually, even with a new machine, it's nice to have the old
laptop as the print/receipt station. The desktop will probably be kept
as a web browser only. No fancy or fast compute on it.

Going to post launch video and first tiktok shop product
tomorrow. I'll start demoing the product more and more in the coming
weeks. The way I see it, bangbangcon is already the big marketing
stunt.

* 08/20/2024
** Summary
Bed late last night and again today. Third app store submission
requested, basic launch video though I think it could be tighter.

At SC, responding to all feedback on PR, started looking into new bug
and reviewed a few PRs. Then got a late night page from Tommmy about
track manager.

Mailed package to bangbangcon.

Provisional patent is almost ready. Need sleep.

Website cutover tomorrow with some basic video example. Embed youtube
is fine. Constrain dimensions. SC work will be more bug bashing.

Community lunch in the office maybe.

* 08/19/2024
** Summary

After some tedious debugging, got the distro cap modal work sorted
out. After work, packed order for bangbangcon and juggled building new
version of app. Old hardware makes the test loop slow (remote build,
async unbound time waiting for apple).

Had a bit of a scare but just before attempting to deploy a patch for
more exploring; realized it was user (me) error in the write
process. Yes!!!! Consistent production and reading modes now.

Tomorrows work is video creation, provisional patent and production
cutover. Also packaging and mailing the buttons for
bangbangcon. Ziplock bags + padding in big box? Probably good
call. UPS or USPS?

For SC work tomorrow, get us set up with Rive animation. More bug
backlog. Ping Lunch.js.

** Summary
Android app looks good, made order for bangbangcon, printed backing
for it which looks aaaaawesome. Inspiring for consignment.

Apple and Android play store submitted for review. Should test again
on android (the modal).

After day job, tomorrow's focus is to package and mail bangbang and file the
provisional patent.

* 08/17/2024
** Summary
MBC android is running on device but eas play store submission isn't
working. Maybe once first/non-draft state works.

Some layout oddities. Made intro gifs albeit suuuuuper fast because I
only had Mariana's phone for 30min. Can update it later in the
week. Not a deal breaker, but better to get the intro video nailed.

Made buttons for the family. Felt good. Talked with Jason for a bit
and played solo pickleball with Mariana for a bit.

* 08/15/2024
** Summary
Long day. Good. Went to office with Leche. Paired with Jeff on sc4a
bug. Fixed then did my work. Leche roamed around freely in the
office. Had to throw her food away because ants got to it really quick.

Mariana is really enjoying her boxing class and I'm happy for
her. She's doing kickboxing next. Maybe both though.

MBC is almost ready with ios and android apps. Provisional patent by
Monday. Test using special cardstock paper is awesome but too many
unknowns so I ordered another type. Thinness/weight is a huge
factor. Maybe some without sticker backing?

If none of those work, plain ol design is the way to go.

Bed. Admin app is building

** Summary
Some conflicts on work today with other devs. Repro'd how to fix but
then had to rebase after Jeffs work. Github also went down making
things even more fun.

Did a lift after work. My neck is better after that tweak (two weeks
ago) and I felt pretty good in the hours to follow.

After work, charged my old android phone to test expo app, made custom
tiktok shop order, login working, app looks good. Need to confirm it
works on android then its production polish (gifs) after making test
assets. Should be able to submit by EOD tomorrow.

** Summary
Woke up. Deep sleep. Synced with Janik on upload ticket. Dove into the
sc4a modal condition ticket. Hairy.

After work, nearly finished the consumer mobile app. Have to do all
builds through eas until i get a new machine (waiting for m4) since
it's near the end of release cycle.

EAS updates should work (as a codepush alternative) though cost $ per
user install. That's fine for now, but maybe codepush is better if its
still in development. Tradeoffs since I'll hit EAS cap anyway. It's
expensive to be poor as they say.

New build is going up, then bed. Tomorrow wfh.

** Summary

Super deep sleep. Wrote some tests for SC. Sprint planning too. After
work, MBC ready to share with family. Also fulfilled order (one for 16
items, the other for 10 free).

Super hot today. Took Leche on a mid day walk. Scorching.

Got create user and login done for the app. User creds are important
if I ever want to add features and not just a utility. Maybe after
launch. Testflight by EOW. Submit to app store then too.

Mail demos on Wednesday (priority if not too expensive)

** Summary
Pretty good day. Not as much done as yesterday. I really do fly when I
have long periods of focused time and my thoughts. Adaptable though.

Grocery shopped in evening after getting basic ios scaffold up (intro
slides mostly done, create user api done but not integrated).

Made a cucumber, pepper and black bean salad. Roasted some tomatoes,
onion, garlic, jalepeno for salsa. Started cooking Leche's food.

Bed.

** Summary
Caught up on sleep. Bed at 1am (ish) and woke up at 10am. Started MBC
work by 1pm. Juggled laundry but did a lot. Tomorrow the consumer
app. Got the new costume from Ian and Jay-Yu on Friday. Client app
finished tomorrow, then dynamic shipping estimation from address, then
email / customer scripts (tracking code email)

Shipping rates is more important. Do that

After about 4 hours of focused time, went to Echo park with Mariana to
meet Andrew and Moti who invited us to row boats on the lake. Ate
sandwiches at park. There was a guy with downsyndrome dancing for
money. We first rode our swan boat as far as we could before getting
yelled at that we went past the bouey boundary. Afterward, walking
back to the car, a group of dudes were recording rap battle between
two dudes. In Spanish. Fun time. Came home and did the prod cutover.

Bed.

* 08/08/2024
** Summary

Biked to office. Dropped off another MBC order on the way. Tiktok shop
is mostly smooth process.

Fixed bug at work. After work, got fulfillment APIs written and
partially integrated in app.

** Summary
Not much sleep last night while trying to figure out Xcode issue. EAS
for the win. Our intern Anna demo'd her summer project and the team
loved it.

Fixed a bug; had going away empanadas.

Back home, got the admin app working (basics).  Should refactor it to
"Step 1 -- Step 2 -- Confirm -- Finalize". The finalization step will
help show when order is done. Return count in response and alert.

** Summary

Mariana was still super sick this morning. High fever and couldn't
stomach food. Fever went down later but no fun being weak.

FE interview candidate today. Resubmitted sc4a bug fix.

Spent several hours trying to get RN app compiled on my ancient
machine. Later versions of xcode are required to build most of the RN
tool chain and delever via testflight or other. Unfortunately later
versions of xcode only run on newer hardware. Backporting RN to older
versions seemed promising but then the testflight sdk requirements for
distribution got in the way.

Was almost ready to sleep but then looked for hosted xcode solutions
and remembered expo has one! Several others out there too. One of them
should solve

** Summary
Shipped 3 MBC orders although tiktok tracking says waiting to
receive. We'll see if one gets refunded because of that.

SC bug bash and ack'd Jeff's feedback. Tired. Jumped rope to get the
blood flowing.

Mariana is sick with sore throat and now fever. Stayed home and
rested. Made some soup and got some otc drugs for her. Leche is good
girl and sits with her as she knows she feels bad.

Admin MBC app nearly done though i'm having to jump through hoops to
get it working on old machine. They're on their last leg so I'll start
budgeting for new one.

After M4 mbp come out would be a good target. Need to spec it. Desktop
lasted 10 years, laptop lasted 13. Good times. They're still great,
just not daily drivers.

Need to lower MBC admin dependency versions incrementally. App builds
just fine, but major/minor versions are messing with xcode.

** Summary

A few more organic (no marketing) sales on tiktok. Pickleball in the
evening. Fun. Played two cocky old timers. They were better but we
scared them and held a lead

Have order fulfillment script done. Need to compile RN on old machine,
but POC nearly done.

** Summary

Woke up and got coffee from Coffee Bean. Worked on order fulfillment
script MBC. Went to Venice from 1-4 then Northgate market, then walked
Leche, then packed an order for MBC. Didn't plan on it, but finally
tested the tiktok shop process.

Let's see how it pans out after USPS drop off tomorrow.

Pickleball with Mariana after a few hours at home. Played with new
friends out there Carlos and Maggie then Ash and Jackie.

Sunburned a bit. Incredible Sun today, no breeze, clear sky, not too
hot. Noticeably amazing Sun.

* 08/02/2024
** Summary
Couldn't sleep so stayed up for MBC polish. Receipt + emails then
order fulfillment flow. Then app. Then videos.

SC work was bug bashing and fixed one. Went to office with Leche who
liked growling at the neighbor cat.

Thinking about the Universe again.

Pickleball with Mariana after work.

Listened to Toumani Diabate.

** Summary

Good day. Neck tweak was funny. Doesn't hurt as bad as camping trip
injury but somehow related. Thinking about it.

SC4A work. Got a ping from Ben Upsavs. Lady who works at Rose Market
gave me a free almond croissant as Leche and I were walking home. That
was nice.

WFH office tomorrow

Great day. YOLO. Workout in morning. New MBC launch date and plan.

Good day. I have new clarity on MBC.
Went to SC office at 8am with Leche. Team breakfast didn't order enough but lunch was good.
Came home with Leche at 2pm after finishing most work.
Studied path forward for MBC. Drizzle has lots of benefits. Cleaning up code.
Afternoon meditation and americano helped.

Little sleep last night really through off the energy today until a
workout. The workout was a on fumes but felt solid after it. Still
tired.

Deployed accordion feature, investigated load issue.

Going to bed and looking into transactional emails for MBC.

** Summary
Woke up, walked Leche to farmers market for coffee while Mariana went
to kickball. Read more of 1PMP. Went to beach with Mariana and
Leche. Met David, Pau and Remi. Paddleboard. There was some seaweed on
the floor of the bay that we kept stepping on and freaking out
thinking we were stepping on stingray of fish. Hilarious.

Came home and washed Leche. She's getting really responsible and
jumped in the tub by herself. Mariana washed her, I dried. I drove to
Sprouts and Smart & Final after for some weekly groceries and Leche's
chicken.

Made a soyrizo pasta. Leche had eggs. She's wiped from today and tried
to go to bed early.

Going to bed.

* 07/20/2024
** Summary
Woke up, read more of the 1 Page Marketing Plan. Posted premade MBC
video. Played pickleball with Mariana after late lunch at Rockenwagner.

Full moon tonight and tomorrow.

Good time.

* 07/19/2024
** Summary
Woke up to play golf with Jon at Rancho. Fun game but I realize I
don't have time for golf right now so will delay it till the new year
or later. Worked from office. Saw capstone project demo and submitted
ffmpeg wasm issue. Reviewed some PRs

Back home, read and started part 1 of "1-page marketing plan" some
parts are tedious but it does get the juices flowing. A few personas
but will meditate on which is most viable or tactics on communicating
in one channel to multiple personas. Also in converting from my
current channel niche to a wider message format.

Watched some Shark Tank with Mariana before bed.

Tomorrow, I'll continue the avatar exercise, more on the 1pmp and get
automatic emails setup. Later, tidy the code and start studying
drizzle. Run through a demo of it on d1 to get familiar.

Bed.

** Summary
Woke up, arch talk about tools I find valuable. Leche walk, refinement
later, focus session (no coworkers interested), fixed wasm issue. Did
a quick lift. Salad and beans for lunch. Coffee walk with Leche. After
work, modified the MBC cropper. Maybe better to hire a designer before
launch? Focus on getting enough done so I can make adverts for
it. Sept is advert creation time.

* 07/16/2024
** Summary
Day flew by. Deep dreams and a bit of sleep talking I caught myself
in. Woke up with allergy attack still. Walked Leche, went biked to
work, worked on wasm issue. 100 pushups while at work. Lunch with Jon
and Adam, talked about "first fans".

Bug bash with team.

Walked Leche a few times after work.

Researched "successful side projects" launched while founders had full
time job. Spanx, cards against humanity, go pro, tattly

Bed. Will workout in the morning before early calls.

** Summary
Weaning coffee until I have a plan for MBC. Fixed big bug today. Kinda
overwhelmed but writing helps. Walked on treadmill during work. Did a
rushed workout after. Laundry later. Played with Leche at
lunch. Leaving windows open during the day is just as good as
AC. Better really. Avoid social media if I'm not posting.

Good energy. Didn't do everything I planned from yesterday but systems
are good. Closed old tickets at SC, went into office for lunch and
afternoon work after morning meetings.

Groceries after work. Made scalloped potatoes. Fish for Mariana. Tofu
for me.

Beditation.

the computer once. I notice angst when thinking of side product launch
in November. Need to create a plan because my morning routine is
struggling. Even this routine (nightly summaries) is struggling. Very
easy to slip into thousands of tiktok videos and get lost in the
noise. Open question is: what does the video rhythm look like and do I
pre-record those videos or not?

I'm not reading, writing side code/product or exercising regularly
which explains the unease.

Calm. Patience. Unplug and create start the plan before October.

Write down everything on your mind, estimate complexity, order
it. Document milestones and options for the future.

SC work is okay. Upload will be very polished by launch.

Going to bed with a postive meditation.

Woke up, 830am Creator SOS call. Will be good to have more focus on
upload. The MBC video post didn't post, so tried it again before work.

Got a solution the team agrees on for inherited fields. Need tests.

Fixed animation with Izzy. Chat with Sarah about upload states.

Did a group workout with Travis and Brandon.

Bennys tacos for dinner. Leafy greens will be good. Been having a lot
of bean, rice and cheese burritos. Lazy but tasty food.

Mariana asked for 3 weeks vacation in October. Will wait for answer
but need to get mind right.

Golfing with Jonathan tomorrow morning.

** Summary

Woke up, EPD meeting at 730, PT at 9am, standup at 10, biked to
office, focused on the parent -> trackList problem. Benny's tacos for
lunch. Biked home. Played with Leche for a minute. Longboarded with
Mariana in the street. Cooked picadillo (turkey and tofu). Prototyped
image preview code for MBC. Writing an e2e test for each major link
type would be good. Could be as simple as a script that cURLs.

** Summary

Woke up, made coffee and hour of power with Dad. Good call. Pretty
close to MBC launch. Get focused.

Leche woke up at 3:30am to Leche walking around asking to go
outside. She wanted to eat grass so I sat outside while watching the
moon while she ate grass. Probably 10min. Good sleep though.

Hot day, stayed inside with AC. Some edge cases to work on album
ticket.

Mariana and I have been doing a 14 day fitness challenge with her
boxing class. Missed the last three days so I did them all after
work. Went to grocery store after. Spent more than usual because there
wasn't a strong grocery list. Also more staples.

Had the day off today for Juneteenth. Made videos for MBC tiktok and

Went to lindy hop and it's starting to make sense.

** Summary
Back at work. Lots of context shifting (slack messages) after sprint
planning. Figured out the AdvancedSettings issue and reviewed a huge
PR.

Chinese leftovers (tofu, rice, greens) for lunch. Jumped rope after
work. Mariana went to boxing class then we did a 15min boxing warmup
after. We're doing a 14 day boxing challenge with her class.

Showered then went to smart & final for Leche's food. Tomorrow have PT
in the morning. Not going to schedule any more. Waste of money.

Researched D1 a bit and looked into "drizzle" ORM tool. Seems
promising. Maybe less risk than other cloud dbs (cloudflare, i mean,
though drizzle is pretty popular)

Got loads done this weekend. Bulk pricing model, now on tiktok
shop. Shared the product I'm launching in Sept with Ian and
Jay-Yu. Had coffee with them on Saturday then lunch on Sunday with a
workout thrown in there. Nice. Matthew and Bree were in town for a
show and hung out at our place before the show. Mariana was in TJ for
the weekend. Long walks with Leche. It was pretty on hot so she took
her time. I know I'm mentally preoccupied. Slowing down on weekends
like now to do chores is great.

Anniversary dinner on Tuesday. Juneteeth holiday on Wednesday. Most of
this week is about refactoring

Hanging in there. Good energy for most of the day. Workout in the

in Venice was closed. How to train for hangry?

Good to bounce ideas off Jai-Yu and Ian. Delivered the second round of
buttons they ordered. Three veggie hotdogs and fries for me.

** Summary
Words are important. As my teachers used to say, "some people have
diarrhea of the mouth" suggesting they don't think before they
speak. Good to think on.

Tomorrow, deep focus on the form problem. Stillness. New sprint work
for Anna. I have a PT appointment at 11am (silly) and our lunch
outting after. I'll only make part of the PT appointment before
heading into the office.

Nosotros hablamos solomente en espanol los martes ahora. Empieza manana.

Beditation.

** Summary
Fasted today until noon. Felt good. Broke it with a salad (kale,
cucumber, pepper, tomato, bellbepper, beans).

Arch meeting at 8am, updated testing doc based on the team chat, sc4a
feature is nearly done but needed to help get Anna VPN access then
debug her ticket. Good progress though.

Thermal printer arrived. Mailing out latest order tomorrow during lunch.

Color printer is fixed. It probably works better with brighter,
heavier paper. Investigating

Lindy Hop at 8pm. Fun today, practiced basics (1-2, tripple step) and
learned the "square off" and turn.

Walked Leche afterwards

** Summary
Rushed day because I went to bed late and woke up early. No reason,
just bad planning and stayed glued to phone looking for good songs and
musicians.

PT in the morning, quick walk with Leche, biked to office, sprint
planning and met our summer intern, debugged a prod issue with
Axinja. Order fulfillment for MBC. Had to got to Staples since ink
appears messed up. That forced me to upgrade toner cartridges. Found
some that are within return policy and significantly cheaper than
HP brand toner. Fingers crossed.

Also made a short video for a musician.

Scrolled and book marked some new music and artists to promote. Stayed
up pretty late though, maybe because of 3pm matcha.

Leche stayed at the house from 930am till 3pm(ish) by herself. Took
her on a long walk and played with her after. Intended to be back by 1
but needed to wait for Anna to get her computer.

Bed.

** Summary

Chores today. Felt good. Did workout. Not all chores I wanted but good
start. Waking up early to drop Mariana off for a hike she's doing with
her boxing class.

Went to the Santa Monica pier to play DDR and ride two rides (the
ferris wheel and the flippy sidewinder one). Fun.

Thinking about shipping options for MBC product. Shipping APIs is a
new challenge. I could do free shipping for minimum orders $5 shipping
anywhere in the USA? Shipping outside USA?

Home now, going to bed.

Finished the track item ticket, vercel meeting, played with Leche at
lunch, walked 3.5 miles throughout the day. After work, filmed first
part of MBC videos, while doing it, got a purchase from focusmate
user, made those in the evening.

Didn't make soup as Mariana said she'd get food from grocery.

** Summary
Back from the long weekend in Santa Barbara. Drove over on Saturday
night, stayed at Motel 6 near the beach. Great location, reasonable
hotel (too small though) with a tiny pool Mariana liked. Got a good
laugh when we arrived because the photos make the pool look massive.

Day one we had late lunch at a tavern. Lazarro is looking healthy. Two
bottom teeth coming in. Mariana taught him a funny game. She stuck out
her tongue to make faces at him. He loved it and tried to mimic
her. Apparently he's blowing raspberries too.

The next day we drove over to Goleta to see Omar and Marcella at their
place. We walked to the beach and saw a snake on the way. About a 3
footer. It had just eaten. The beach was "no dogs" so we didn't let
Leche run freely. Other owners did but we don't have great recall with
her. Especially not when there are that many birds on the shore. She
loved it though. Found a great walking stick too. Almost the one I had
beend dreaming of for MBC but not quite. My vision is fuzzy on that
and didn't want to bring something I wasn't going to use, so I left
it.

Monday, I woke up and walked to coffee. Leche and Mariana slept
in. When back, we walked to the beach. I went to pick up breakfast
which took longer than expected because the spot we picked (Jeannie's
on the beach) had a shortened to-go menu. Found a bakery near by that
looked good. Delicious hashbrowns formed and fried in a square with
some curry seasoning. Mariana didn't want any until I stressed how
good they were. Right on time, Leche flung up a torrent of sand that
landed all over the hashbrowns. Womp womp. Funny though.

We drove over to Goleta again for another late lunch, this time at a
natural foods place around the corner from them. Delicious. I had a
tempeh burger and slice of carrot cake. Drove home and was back in a
foggy LA by 6 or so. On the way, our oil light came on so I topped us
off at the gas station.

The new rule is to top us off before any long trip. Which means
outside LA.

Today, I had a sinus attack and was pretty annoyed by it. Went to PT
at 2pm and had enough pause of my sinuses draining during to still
stretch properly. Pain in shoulder is getting better. Motion is the
key to success here.

Mariana doesn't like the 30-60-90 incline bench design and poo-poo'd
it. Maybe she'll change her mind, but if not, I might buy an incline /
decline combo. More expensive than the triangle, but less expensive
(in dollars and time) than building one and have that fall apart in a
few years.

Took a benedryl to help sleep. Going to bed soon.

** Summary

Woke up, pull ups outside. Ate like trash today, will bounce
back. Coffee in the morning, coffee smoothie from earth bar, free
donut from yesterday's all hands, egg burritos (solid), tofu bahn mi
and some fried movie theater spring rolls and buffalo
cauliflower. Silly.

Went to see Remi with Mariana before watching Furiosa at Culver
Theater. Played with Leche a bit before.

** Summary

Woke up and walked 4miles during the all hands. Lots of Billy Eilish
talk. Bug fixed. Mariana wrapped Leche's foot last night. This morning
Leche was nipping at it and took off most of it. Probably ate some too.

Lifted. Bent over rows seem to help. Good I was warmed up.

Loose attention today after work. Didn't make any videos for MBC. Down
on that. I think my own progressive/growth idea is to get through this
book I'm reading then "figure out" what's next. Reminded of a chat
back in SF with Tony about how (then) I developed the confidence to
stop a book mid reading if I lost interest. I've since change my mind
on that (maybe after having too much free time on my hands back
then). A balance to strike or a hard rule? Library books or a better
reading habit are great for that. If I chew threw a book per week or
per night, it's not the end of the world to have a bad one. Synthesis
and retention though.

Two new patio chairs came in. They look nice. I transplated the tulsi
seeds I've been nursing for the last 3 weeks. Tonight is their first
night outside. I've been hardening them over the last week. Bringing
them out for the day, and inside for the night. Many got their own pot
but lots are sharing. Lots of plants.

Beditation.

** Summary
Woke up to put "how we write tests" in slide format. Request was to
put it in a doc in our repo and open the discussion for everyone.

Fixed e2e ci tests and shared with team. Went to office with Leche for
community lunch. She was pretty well behaved. Probably went a bit nuts
because it was taco day. Her poops look healthy again though there was
some red in the second one much later in the day. No urge for her to
eat grass, lethargy or pain on her belly so keeping a watchful eye and
adding more fiber (sweet potato) to her diet.

Walked back after interview debrief with team.

Went to ballroom + lindy hop dance classes. Much better flow this time
around. Rene had a tip about back nerve pain: stress makes it worse so
try to relax. He also said stretching his knee helped the mid
back. Will try it.

Tomorrow, I'll start 5x5 before all hands then walk at least 4miles
(preferably at 4mph if it's not too loud for the call). Break a sweat
to start the day.

Then, add the "how we test" document before the bug backlog. MBC post
needs to happen, especially since I'm away and AFK this weekend.

Bed.

** Summary

Woke up and went to PT. Really tight today. Felt better after the
electrical stimulation and heating pad. Hurt again in the
evening. Enough to take tylenol twice. First time in a while.

Spoke with Drooker. Worked on e2e tests in CI. Intern sync. Came home
and broke fast with salad then rice and beans.

Arch meeting is on testing tomorrow. Waking up early to convert my
notes into slide format.

Leche was sick today. She through up and had a big of blood in her
stool. Either she ate something she shouldn't have or she caught a
bug. She's been on this new chicken + vegetable + rice diet for 3
weeks now (third week) and her appetite has been great but her stools
have been irregular. Maybe the blood in stool is constipation? Two
days ago she had mucus on her poop too which apparently could indicate
a stomach infection. I pressed on her stomach and sides to see if she was
sensitive but no response. Pretty confident it is a stomach bug but if
there is signs of blood in stool or she continues to want to throw up,
time for vet.

Rest.

** Summary
Woke up at 720 and did a fast barbell workout. All empty bar while my
pinched nerve persists. Mind over matter.

Sold fern on craigslist. Tediously fixed the e2e issues. Not sure why
tests failed. Tomorrow working on arch talk.

Made picadillo for Mariana. Leche had a stange looking poop
today. First part was normal, the second part was covered in a
semi-transparent mucus. Like it was a big sinus booger wrapped
turd. Diet didn't change much yesterday, but two days ago she had eggs
and rice for dinner.

I'm reading a book that's pretty wu-wu culty right now. Lot's of
strong statements for a book that is trying to draw parallels make
metaphors between various cultural artifacts and religions. Some
interesting patterns but sometimes feels like a childrens color book.

Cut my hair after work. Feels good. Hair was looking pretty good
before but drawing my attention and too much to manage. Focus energy
on side project launching in September.

** Summary

Excited for PT tomorrow morning. What exercises can I do safely? I
suspect similar basic moves like the ones I had in SF 6 years
ago.

Got a patch deployed that Luke logged. Also merged the parallel routes work.

After work made assets for side project. Juice.

Bed and meditation.

** Summary
Maru stayed with this weekend. Came here on Thursday night, left this
morning. We went to Getty on Saturday. She spent the day with Mariana
on Sunday. I didn't do any work this week, nothing productive. Scapula
feels like its getting better, less extreme pain but some positions
still really suck.

Going to bed.

* 05/09/2024
** Summary
Amazing. Scapula felt pretty okay for most of today. Up until 4pm when
it came back. Maybe it's stress induced? Doesn't explain why I woke up
with the pain in previous days. Still monitoring. Was numb at dinner
and afterward.

Maru arrived at 5pm, we walked to doughroom for dinner.

Walked back, made tulsi. Walked Leche when Mariana came home. Went to
Trader Joe's for Leche's birthday dinner and CVS for bow.

Working from office tomorrow. Reading in bed.

* 05/08/2024
** Summary
Good day. Sleep was rough. Woke up with full arm numb. Tylenol. WFH
until noon when I went to office for community lunch. Worked there for
a bit, then biked home to finish work before heading back to the
office for group pilates class. Originally planned location got
relocated to playa vista but still good. Intense stuff.

Biked home and realized I lost my keys. Scatter brained with this
arm. Never happens. Turns out I left them in the cubby at the pilates
studio. Drove there to pick them up. On the way back, made a spare key
at home depot.

Cleaned the house with Mariana and watched a rediculous amount of
tiktok videos. Some good songs to promote on MBC.

Bed.

** Summary

Life is good. Noisy right now and a monkey on my back (pinched nerve)
but it's good to be alive. I would love to feel some natural
endorphines though and feel pretty restless due to not wanting to
continue to injure myself. Maybe that fear is unnecessary. Maybe I can
still do weighted workouts, just carefully with certain range of
motion. Squats would be nice. Bench too, but I can hardly do full
pushup without hurting.

Drawing book showed up today. How am I to use this? Character design
for MBC? Animation for MBC?

Mariana went to boxing class today after work. Seemed stressed.

Mom texted photo of Houston as she gets ready for move. Nice photo.

Bed time. Sleeping with hot water bag on neck.

** Summary
Shoulder and arm still pinched. Physical therapy can't come soon
enough. Swam this weekend. Fun, but I'm pretty obsessed with this
pinched nerve. I've let it control most of my mood which stinks. Pull
up strength is still trash.

MBC side project is brutal. The daily drip of posting content I've
already recorded is rough especially because it feels so heartless to
pre-record. For the next batch of pre-recorded ones, I'll note them in
different contexts (doing dishes, in shower, playing board games, etc)

Clarity please. Should probably stop CBD too. Might make the shoulder
pain harder to bear, but the angst go away.

** Summary
Some good flow today. Calisthenics to help with shoulder. What to do
for May, June, July, August? Project? More side project grinding?
Unsure. Meditating on this in bed.

Tough day. Went to urgent care to get PT referral. Pain was rough
enough, could barely focus. Starting to cycle tylenol.

Finished sprint work today.

730 yoga. Some woman farted five times. She was struggling to keep it
in. Held in my laughter. Was tough though.

Some back and forth about the planters and plants to put in
them. Short attention span on both our parts. Detox from
screens.

** Summary
I'm going to schedule a phone detox. When I don't set goals, I slip
into scolling. I've been pretty good with "chopping wood" type-goals
(do XYZ every day for 1 year) but those quickly turn into
non-progressive goals which eventually defeats the purpose. May, June,
July and August are all opportunities to do real stretch goals before
phase 2 of side project. Meditation, studying, yoga, calisthenics are
all on the mind

Woke up at 730am, walked on treadmill for morning call from
8-9am. Walked Leche. Standup at 10am. Implemented "Add tracks".

Not a lot if you think about it. Inefficient maybe while I recover
with this neck tenseness.

Yoga after work. Intense. Hamstrings are tight. Impressive what the
instructor can do.

Sitting meditation in bed.

Crossfade launch day today. 7am launch, stayed online till
noon. Deploy went smooth. A few patches to make it smoother.

Bee pollen day 1. No sinus attack but that might not be
related. Pinched nerve was loooooads better than yesterday. Tightened
up again after work / toward the end of the day. No pain medicine
though.

Leche pooped finally. She's on a new diet of chicken, rice and
vegetables while on an antibiotic. Several days of no poop. Pobrecita.

Mariana and I played soccer inside with a tennis ball and Leche played
all-time-goalie. She loved it.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am for 730 call with Dad. Pinched nerve still here. Lying
on ground and stretching neck appears to help but then went to the
gym, rode bike for hour (low key) and read. Afterward, back to the
same tight neck pain.

Tried hanging upside down today but my shoulder mobility is severely
limited. That was kind of a wake-up call to do more deep
stretches. Wondering if sleeping on hard surface like I did when
camping will help. Focus on the spine and the neck's position.

Work was bug hunting from today's crossfade go/no-go call.

Last chapter of Solaris in bed. Thinking about calisthenics. Thinking
about giving an update to MBC audience about pausing.

Bed.

** Summary
Drove to SLO and camped with Jered this weekend. Rained pretty hard so
we went to SLO to wait out the rain before hiking Bishops peak for a
bit. Went halfway up, I went a 20min up on my own then back. 10
condors (vultures?) flying. Worked up an appetite, went to Firestone
grill afterward.

Pinched a nerve under my left scapula. Not much relief with it so
hoping time and stretching heals it. Today, interviewed intern
candidate in last round. Next part of tracklist work.

What is it about travel that requires the change in routine. That can
be changed.

** Summary

Long day. A number of fires that slowed dev work. New tires on the car
in the morning and picked up after work. Picked up Mariana after a
miscommunication whilst an outage was happening. On vacation for the
next few days.

Will read and unplug.

** Summary
Focused on the tracklist hookup. Bigger refactor in the works. Cleaned
up the error page vector image for animation. Dance class at 7pm. Got
a flat and changed the tire with Mariana after. Benny's tacos for
dinner. Gas. Tomorrow morning I'll figure out where to get tires.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am and made hot cacao. Quick bench press then leads
meeting. Walked to Rose market with Leche. Biked to office. Debugged
bug on staging. View only changes for tracklist.

Sinuses acted up a bit. Ordered bean and cheese from Benny's. It's not
made with care. Last time. Maybe with rice next time...probably not.

Biked home. Took Leche on a few walks, including to Mariana's
studio. Added some more designs to MBC. Have some product photography
I want to take after work tomorrow.

Dance class with Mariana tomorrow.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am. Restful sleep. Didn't record my dreams but two
"phases" of them. One before 6am and another from 6am-7am.

Saw the partial eclipse at 11am. Talked with neighbors whilst. Leche
bit some small hair off a sweet big dog. No bueno. The other dog was
okay but they got in a little tornado and Leche doesn't play it cool.

Worked on tracklist today. Some designs for MBC later. Worked in
sunshine for a bit. Amazing.

Fasted until lunch. Ate too much. Caffeine to recover but overshot it.

Reading Solaris in bed.

** Summary

Ran half marathon at "Finish the Run 2024" this weekend. Felt amazing
afterward. Seriously for like 3 hours after, felt super
high/euphoric. Not like drugs, like pure/unadultered focus. Like all
cobwebs were removed and I was bathed in joy. Sounds silly to write. I
wasn't manic or uncontrolled, just "extremely content".

Went to breakfast afterward and high started to fade a bit. Maybe from
the indulgent eating throughout the day, maybe just from time. Still,
mostly clean eating until the evening when I returned to leftover
pizza.

Watched "Legend" this weekend. What fun. Great costume design, simple
story. I loved the whole thing. Great fantasy story. Tim Curry's
performance was spot on.

Sunday, woke up and continued reading "Solaris" with some hot
cacao. Mariana went to her kickball game, I read outside in the sun. I
fasted until sundown, then broke it with a lemon salad with pickled
cabbage. Had some electrolyte drink throughout the day. Synthetic.

Recorded more tiktok videos, this time in a format copying david
lynch's "lucky number" videos. Was surprised to see as many likes as
it got. Will continue testing that. It could be tiktok internally
boosting it because I hadn't posted in a while though. Lower effort
than previous videos.

Played lots of "FLUX" with Mariana this weekend. We went to grocery
store together just now.

This week, we start a new sprint and likely more of the "multi-track
upload" flows, though that CDN and testing tickets should be thought
out more. We'll also finalize which interns make it to the next stage.

Going to read in bed. Solaris hooks you from the first few pages. End
of first chapter especially.

Tomorrow is a total solare eclipse. We will plan better for the next
one. Loved the first one we saw in Oregon. Alex and Mona will love it.

** Summary
Woke up at 7am, stretched. Made matcha then walked on treadmill for
arch meeting. Shared quick pitch for Rive then later demo'd to
designers. Interviewed two intern candidates.

First dance classes with Mariana today. Fun. Lot's to remember but
most importantly (for now) is posture.

Bed time.

** Summary

Went for a short run at 6am. Meetings from 7am-10am. Biked to office
after standup. Two intern interviews. One didn't show. Put up
animation comparison PR. Hope we go with Rive if only it means I get
to familiarize myself with that tool more.

After work I started farting around with figma and drafting ideas for
how we could animate a intern progress over 10 weeks idea. Good to
scope if this is realistic given other goals. Circle up a hill?
Animated badges with outlined SC logo?

Mind is racing with the thrill of animation and design ideas. It's
like being in a candy store, or hearing great music for the first time
even though my skills to play at that level aren't there at
all. Humbling and exhilarating.

Woke at 7am. Made hot cacao and prepared for the day. Fasted until
5pm. Interviewed two intern candidates. Added more tests to dropzone
branch. Arbitrarily complex. If it's hard to write tests, we aren't
writing our code in an organized way. Some parts could use this
attention.

Wrote my last book reviews from the L&D summary.

Running tomorrow and Thursday before the big run this weekend.

** Summary
Weekend flew by. Friday, woke up early and went on a 4 mile run before
playing pickleball with coworkers. Jonathan cancelled so it was just
me, Tommy and his wife. We only got one game in before paddle tennis
old fart starting throwing nonsense around and bullied us off the
court. Real nasty. Whole lot of pretty entitled for a shared space.

Saturday was sick from that run. Sinus infection or whatever happens
after long runs. How to train against that? Maybe run with more
explicit nose breathing? Stayed inside. It rained.

Caught up on sleep for Sunday. Arie, Erie and Eric's dog, is staying
with us this weekend. She's more anxious than usual.

Finished "The Creative Act". Enjoyed a lot of it. Also enjoyed the
focused space to rest. Archived my notes for "How to live"

Fasted today and broke it around 5pm. Felt great all day. Broke it
with a grapefruit, then orange, then almonds, then cashews, then soup.

Tomorrow, will interview a few candidates for the internship.

Going to bed.

** Summary
Somethings aren't worth the attention. Many things maybe. Tail wagging
the dog.

Short run this morning at 645am. Too much light in the day.

Biked to work and focused on the dropzone refactor. Looking good but
more refactoring to come. Beautiful code is a temptation. Requires the
team thinking in beautiful code. Think about tools for
this. Distributed team.

Reading in bed.

** Summary
Woke up and bug bashed with Moritz. Biked to office. Fixie is weird,
too much tought required and i'm not interested in that project right
now. New airless tire is great though. Plan was to have lunch with
Mariana at office but Marie is in town and she had lunch with her.

Came home, took Leche to anawalt to get fungicide. Why? Why waste time
and money on it? Patience and effort would have done just as good. I
learned a bit from talking with the store rep but not much. Learned
that other shoppers were just as squirely in their questions.

Ordered pizza for dinner and watched a movie. Mariana chose "Napolean
Dynomight" because she hadn't seen it. I tuned out and frankly so did
she. I told her I always thought it was only a "meme movie". A cult
phenom, with some jokes but mostly over the top.

Going to bed. Running half marathon in the morning again. Deep
stretches this time.

** Summary
Woke up at 545 and was running by 615 after deep stretch and
electrolytes. Solid run with no side pain. 8am-11am meetings, walked
on treadmill. Returned to multi-track work.

Airless tire arrived today. Installed it after work. Installed bike as
fixie to try that out. Rode it around the street, didn't like it very
much but will give it a try tomorrow. Dinner of curry lentils and
rice. Delicious.

Rhinitis after this morning's run. Reddit users say after consistent
running, it'll go away. Mayo clinic says to breathe through nose while
running or warm up the nasal cavity first. I'll do that tomorrow
morning during deep stretch.

Having lunch with Mariana at the SC office tomorrow.

Bedtime. In order to stop this nose running.

** Summary
Great energy today after morning run. Deep stretch and electrolytes
before run, no hip side pain.

Worked on e2e tests. Made rice and beans for dinner. Attention starts
to get fuzzy and scattered after the long work day.

Didn't overeat at lunch and kept two caffeine drinks (matcha, in the
morning). Also aided with the energy.

Leche worked from Mariana's office too so maybe that had something to
do with the focus. Maybe not.

Bedtime.

** Summary

Woke up at 7am. Deep rest after long drive. How can I make the trip
there and back without feeling drained? More exercise? More
stretching? Finishing the unpack/chores before bed? Writing the game
plan on travel day so it's not just "head back to LA"?

Anyway, no morning meeting but I was online by 8am. Pagerduty alerts
need to be tuned. Only keep the capacity ones IMO.

Finished the "code org" ticket. Chat with Tommy. Hitting the backlog
tomorrow.

After work: did workout, made dinner, made sauerkraut, measured bike
tires and ordered airless ones, household supplies from amazon, baked
sweet potatoes for the week. Mended socks while Mariana watched
TV. Folded laundry.

Lot's of little stuff piles up. Keep having fun with MBC
videos. Excited to read something fun after these mindset books.

** Summary

In TJ this weekend. Left on Thursday night at 7pm, in town by
10pm. Went to a futbol game on Friday with Maru, Mariana, Leo and his
friend. Made a poor decision and ate mac & cheese, grilled cheese
there. Paid for it the next morning. Dumb.

Had great lunch at Vegan place before then. Saturday was chill. Ran in
the morning, then drove downtown for breakfast with Mariana and for
her to pick up a new retainer.

Meditated on conversation most of the day.

Family came over for lengua dinner Maru made. I didn't eat for two
reasons: I don't eat meat and I was still full from late lunch of my
dish and some of Mariana's.

Maru was kind and offered to make fried cheese dinner. I have
definitely fallen off my health goals on many fronts. I could and
should have packed some grains and beans I could eat. I don't have a
real goal in mind other than "eat when I'm hungry and eat nutritious
foods that I'm lacking". Often, not practicing that goal as the Friday
futbol game and fried cheese dinner demonstrate. No biggie, something
to keep in mind for improving.

I forget how therapuetic writing is. Brings order to thoughts. Just
dump it all on the page and delete or PRIVATE-ize it. Feel some
clearer vision about MBC.

Not sure what I'll do after the half-marathon. It's more of a time
commitment than 5x5, less than bouldering. Running 4 miles in ~40min,
several times per week vs lifting 5x5 3.5 times per week at
40min. Pretty even, except running requires one BIG run every
weekend. Those mornings could be spent on MBC, but I don't have a "big
thing" to do for the project in place of running. Perhaps filming lots
more videos or getting the v1 website up. Do the videos then do the
website.

Heading back to LA today.

Left for LA around 2pm, home around 5:30pm. Traffic and additional
delay since border entry line was way further south this
time. Strange. Also the first time I've seen USA's border side staffed
on entry into Mexico.

Came home, Mariana went to see Pau and Remi real quick. I went grocery
shopping after. Bed time.

Good, solid rest last night. Woke up at 6:45, bathroom, tea and at
computer with thoughts by 7:20am.

Thinking about personal accountability this morning. Why I stopped the
"fun websites" rhythm and how to produce the MBC tiktok videos
efficiently (once per month)

Job description for internship is due on Friday. Focused work day at
office. Biked home but got a flat tire. Now's the time to replace them
with solid rubber wheels.

** Summary
Less inflamation after yesterday's run today. Knees hurt a bit but got
better throughout the day. Will run it again on Thursday.

Wrote eslint plugin for our tests. Going through the motions. Found
some flow when I stood at desk with binaural white noise.

** Summary

Dad and Alex stayed yesterday. Made bimbibap for dinner and played
Catan. Really fun. Dad's first time playing and lots of belly
laughs. Woke up at 630 and made coffee for Dad when he woke up later.

Found the videos I want to make for this month. Filmed 3. Filming them
all in one day will give lots more leverage. Good idea to do "the one
thing" exercise again but with the focus of "fun". Then another for
"quality product" or "portfolio product".

It would probably take a full day to record the month's videos.

Going to bed. Running the half marathon tomorrow. I suspect, 3 hours
in total given that I may need to walk some of that 4 mile uphill.

** Summary
Woke up at 6am and focused on side project. Not strictly "the one
thing" exercise but instead, started a list of artists to make content
for based on:

- if they have a good song
- less than ~1K followers
- have engaged recently

Still, "the one thing" exercise is important because six months will
fly by. Reverse engineer goal session.

8am call with team. Added more system alarms. After work, did a quick
lifting session.

Mailing Victory Kid's buttons tomorrow. Dad and Alex driving down
tomorrow. Having bimbibap at home and maybe a board game.

Bed.

* 03/06/2024
** Summary
My /now focus for the month of February was to grow a tiktok audience
for my DTC project. Here are some stats:

I posted 19 videos related to the nice, 17 of which were @-mentioning
people within the niche as a growth strategy.

Of these 17, 15 were for strangers ("warmed the cache" by creating
content for some friends). Of those 15, 6 followed me back. One
followed before I posted a video of them. This is the ideal state:
musicians following me in hopes of a video being made.

Of the 6 who followed back, 5 were super active on tiktok (recent
posts and or comments) and had an average number of followers less
than 1K.

That's the sweet before posting more videos. They should:

1. Make a good song recently that they're trying to promote
2. Have less than 1K followers (unless I have a really clever video idea)
3. Have posted within the last week

TODO:
- look for hashtags and sounds at ads.tiktok.com
- record all the videos on the same day
- schedule content

---------------

Woke up at 6am and ran a short 1.5 miles. After work, lots of small tasks since
chore routines off from vacation. During work, setup some alerting.

Retro of tiktok videos suggests I should keep doing it so long as its
not the only thing I do to grow the idea. Running through "The One
Thing" plan seems fruitful if it guides my focus. Tomorrow, I'll skip
going on a run and work on this before work.

** Summary
Woke up and ran 6 miles before work. New route. Around the park and up
and back exposition. Fun but not long enough. Maybe two laps around
the park and down exposition and back next time.

Still on the minification problem. Thinking I have a solution that
might work for community too. Annoying that it's a ghost.

Had a massage at the office as part of employee apreciation
week. Awesome. Grateful for that. Aproval for internship, will draft
the system tomorrow.

** Summary

Good day. Didn't run today, rested. Been a few days since I've done a
big run or any rigorous exercise. Errands all day. Finished MBC
costume, preped materials for MBC content, cleaned kitchen, took Leche
on a longer walk and played outside with her.

Grocery store then basic meal prep for the week. Cleaned
kitchen. Cleaning the stove goes a long way. Did laundry. Sneakers are
getting pretty dirty, not worth the mental energy. Ride them to the
ground.

Bed time after reading.

** Summary
Woke up and still raining so delayed my morning run. Forcast is dry
for tomorrow. Presented the "concise pull requests" speech today. My
cadence wasn't as good as it was last week when I was supposed to
present but oh well.

Interviewed FE candidate and responded to Pablo's comments.

Have all the materials for the MBC costume. Once made, the content
rhythm changes.

** Summary

Woke up at 5am, on the road running by 6am. Tiktok scrolling. Run was
good, tight hips on mile 2 but not as bad as before. Investigated the
crossfade router issue. The problem was only half captured in the
ticket, need a more sophisticated solution. Make sure it doesn't
overlap with others work.

Interviewed eng candidate.

MBC post at lunch. Pasta Sisters for dinner.

** Summary
Woke up today and was sneezy/congested until lunch when I went outside
and got in the sun. Still congested after that but not nearly as bad.

Its basically the same attack I had two weeks ago when I planted fava
beans on Jan 24. Back then I thought it was because I did it in the
cold with shorts and no socks in the cold dirt. Maybe I caught a cold
last night. Wore those shorts but not undies, sweater and socks to
bed. Maybe it's cold.

Sleeping early tonight. Running in the morning

** Summary

Woke up and ran by 6am. Roads and sidewalks were a bit wet but not too
bad. Claudia joined the side project and I made her items after work.

Four hygienic PRs at SC today. One refactoring I'd like to do before
EOW as it relates to the upload work.

Have an idea for daily rhythm of MBC. Will start that in the morning.

Mailers come tomorrow. Need other packaging and to confirm stamps /
rates. A few sessions building spreadsheet would be good too.

Bed.

** Summary
First sunny day since the storm started this weekend. Reviewed code
and wrote some tests. Posted MBC content and wrote down some
ideas. Need to prototype the "music video" idea if i can re-use them.

Played with Leche, she pooped thrice.

Hoping to work on e2e tests tomorrow but yield to the team

Going to prototype MBC a bit before sleep.

courts for three (maybe four?) hours before coming home to watch
LOTR. Watched part two and three on Sunday during the storm.

Went to Ralphs to get that tart Mariana got when we visited Marcella
and Omar. It's a tasty sugar bomb. Felt great after that hike but not
as much when we sat and watched movies all day.

I'm waiting for TikTok to verify my account so I can start
posting...as I type this, I realize I can still make progress: work on
the friggen videos you goof. Post them once you have a link ready. You
can post them in the other networks too. Silly.

** Summary

Pretty good day energy-wise. Soured a bit in the evening.

The rushed anxiety of being done with work, delivery food and the
hurried "let's pick a movie" left me with a terrible feeling. Like
witnessing no discipline and a spoiled child weighing on a tired
parent. Not a good feeling so I took pause to reflect.

Later we watched The Color Purple (the original). It's a well made
story, captivates you for the duration. Oprah looks much
different. Whoopi Goldberg was charming.

Didn't run today for the grounds we still wet and I gave myself that
excuse. I should try it though, running in the rain. Can't be that
bad. Meditation before bed.

** Summary
Broke the fast this morning at 6:30am. With hot cacao and tea. Two
hours later with a bean pancake, lettuce and sauerkraut. Delicious.

Walked Leche, worked from home and re-submitted PR after chasing down
bug I added in PR. Fixed it an resubmitted. A few interrupts after
sharing a dream to animate the design logo.

Food went nearly straight through me all day. Energy was pretty good
though, no sugar crashes but not as "keto-focused" as yesterday
obviously. Also, I felt frustrated that the PR task took as long as it
did.

Made mac n cheese with broccoli for dinner. Rushed to refill our water
before they closed after. Wrote notes on "How to win friends &
influence people". "One Thing" is the next book but only in my down
time. This next month's goal is to focus on getting better content on
tiktok in my side-projects niche. In the morning, I can start similar
creators in my niche. What were their successful posts? How many posts
do they have? What do they charge? What is their minimum unit cost?
Shipping guarantees? Are they creative?

Running the big loop again in the morning

** Summary
Woke up at 5am and went for a 4mile run by 5:30am. Felt great. Fasted
all day. Will break it tomorrow.

Proposed solution for single task queue. Worked from office. At lunch,
biked to USPS and mailed MBC buttons. Went to farmers market for honey
after.

Bike home, walked Mariana to her studio. Back, went to dog store for
Leche food, 99c store to see if they had good organic food (they
didn't) and then sprouts for groceries. Dishes and trash when home,
baked sweet potatoes for tomorrow. Wasted time online while Mariana

** Summary
Not a focused day. Started the day with meetings and stayed unfocused
after that. Lower back and knees hurt a lot. Going on a big run
tomorrow morning.

What if all meetings were only 5minutes. No "break outs", big fat
timer shown on every one's screen, forcing people to be terse with
their words. Game theory though, it's some peoples job to get people
in rooms talking and that's a loose success metric. Noodling on this.

Bed.

** Summary
Yesterday, we drove to Santa Barbara to meet Lazaro. Big boy. Likes to
cry right now. We brought chinese food and a cake. Walked to the beach
and back before driving home. Omar popped the yoga ball while bouncing
Lazaro to sleep.

Today, played pickleball for a few hours in the afternoon. Got lunch at that
french bakery on Pico before going to Anawalt lumber for soil and a
new house plant. We got two bags of soil. Came home and repotted many
of our house plants with new soil. Afterward, Mariana went to the gym
and I transplanted some outdoor plants. The pionsettias I found a few
weeks ago are in the front now. Repotted one of the sapote too.

Pickleball was fun. Played four games. Shirt off all day to catch the
sun. Felt great.

In the evening I disassembeled the apple keyboard I got on craigslist
nd deep cleaned it. The action is a lot harder than the mechanical
keyboard but if its consistent, I won't mind.

Laundry folding before bed.

This week, go/no-go on Mazatlan trip. Tiktok ad for MBC, mail,
re-design intro based on jitter.video's onboard (focused).

* 01/26/2024
** Summary
Fridays are great because there is mostly no plan. Just code.

Woke up and ran by 6:30am. Short 2mi run around Rose. Picked up
keyboard for desktop then dropped off UPS package. Took Leche for a
walk and made her an egg. Biked to work and was pretty focused.

Biked home and had conveyour belt sushi with Mariana. Ate really
fast. Came home, going to bed after reading.

Feel better after sleep.

Couldn't focus much on work.

** Summary
Rainy day, everything was slowed down because of it. Didn't run in the
early morning because it was torential and I don't have a rain
jacket. Did 2mi on the walking treadmill later in the day.

Focus.

Pushups a few times. Researched the multiupload problem.

Moved the cactus I rescued up to the edge of the yard. Will plant fava
beans in small section in a few days and in a two weeks as a test.

Reading, meditation before bed.

** Summary
Mariana didn't want to drive or possibly camp in the rain so we
cancelled the camp trip that morning. Didn't let it phase me, enjoyed
the weekend at home and read. Washed Leche, made a soup, watched a
pretty pandering movie ("Men" by Alex Garland). I enjoyed Garland's Ex
Machina but not this one. Felt too long. Good performance from the
character actor.

Reading "How to Win Friends and Influence people" and am thoroughly
enjoying it. It's prescriptive but focused. 20 or so chapters each
with a principle to focus your attention.

Spoke with Joey last night. Happy for the path he's chosen and the
focus he's setting for himself. Not preaching or judging but want to
encourage health and wealth in all my friends and family.

Bed time.

** Summary
Woke up at 6:30 and ran by 7am. Back and took Leche for walk. Got
Mariana and croissant before returning Leche to her. She spent the day
with Mariana at work. I worked from SC office which was pretty
quiet. We merged the memory leak fix and the upload refactor.

Going to bed. Laundry tomorrow morning before packing the car for
camping. Fasting tomorrow as I overate processed foods today. All
processed fake meat foods. I've slipped from WFPB to lazy vegan. One
was incredibly focused and the other...lazy. Thinking about the food
goal this year. Sweet potatoes I think.

** Summary

Woke up at 6:30 and running by 7am. Intentionally ran a bit faster on
the last leg. Not concerned about timing yet but would be great if my
"unconscious pace" were faster.

Spent the whole day on the memory leak problem. Cornered it but
haven't squashed it. Will spend more time with Josh and team.

Went to Mitsuwa for dinner with Mariana. Threw the ball with Leche
before work. Poor girl was pretty bored all day. Didn't take a break
from computer / bug hunting.

Camping this weekend. Looking forward to it. Will finish the book and
might start the next one.

Reading then bed.

** Summary

Weekend flew by. Saturday we played pickleball, got smoothies,
showered, went over to Pau and David's until the evening. Met
Remi. She looks like David. We played "Guess Who" but with a variant
of David's: "politically incorrect questions only"

Sunday Mariana went to her old coworker's (Aubrey?) birthday party. I
went to grocery store and picked up baked goods for her. Ran, played
with Leche, made big batch of saurkraut (3 heads). If I make it any
bigger next time, I'll use my feet in the tamales pot.

Had today off for MLK day. Woke up refreshed at 5:30am and was on my
run by 6am. Up the hill on Rose st again. Anxious energy most of the
day. Maybe because I got an early but then didn't really do anything
for several hours. My first committed task was at 11am when I decided
to continue reading "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin.

Focused afterward. Overall felt like I put too much on my plate. Has
happened several times before on holiday days. How can I get better?

Did some bench press and took Leche on a long walk up the hill to get
the blood flowing. Did most of the small tasks on my /now list. I
should keep this more high level and keep task lists as a means for
these small items.

Prepared some of the DTC demo. After tomorrow morning's run, will
prepare some more.

Going to bed after reading more.

** Summary

Good day. Ran at 6am before sun. Pickleball with Pablo. Four
games. Lots of tasks that have been nagging me at work. Clear
plate. Good Indian food for lunch, ate it with the team back at the
office. Maybe 200 pushups throughout the day? During my 5min breaks
while focusing. Biked home, then drove to pick up Mariana's gift
(pickleball jerseys).

Went to mall to fix apple tv. Needed to reset IR remote (press home
and volume down). Had food court food first. Came home. TV remote came
in, replaced it.

Going to read before bed.

Woke up at 630 and went for run. In office by 10 and back home to wfh
by 2pm. Nearly finished the day's work. Office with so many meetings
is not productive. Build, review, merge. If we cut our meeting times
in half, I bet we'd still get the same performance.

Went to dinner (vegan place) with Mariana. Going to read before
bed. Running in the morning then playing pickleball with Pablo and
Josh and maybe other coworkers.

Woke up and ran at 7am. Call at 8am then office with Leche at

I won't waste time on unnecessary work meetings anymore.
I will split my focus or leave the meeting if it's not important.

Digestion bad after a strange mix of food. Banana, hemp, oatmilk
smoothy for late snack then tofu, peas, kimchi and rice for dinner an
hour or so later. Farting all night.

Need to book hipcamp, hoping camp host replies tomorrow.

Best habits in myself. Find calm and stretch before bed.

Sleep.

** Summary
Good day. Woke up at 6am and went for run up the hill on Rose
ave. 1.5mi there and back. Good to get some grading training in. The
half marathon looks like a 7% grade if its like years before. That
hill is 6%. Good start.

Lots of coworkers flew out to LA this week so I'm working from office
each day. Nice.

Leche had her teeth cleaned today. Next time I'll do it myself. Good
to get the baseline. It's called "scaling" your dogs teeth.

** Summary
Back in LA after weekend in TJ. Woke up for a run at 8am then went to
Baristi. The house was still asleep when I got back so I made tea and
read outside. Very windy but sunny. Had breakfast with Mariana and
Maru. Religion, culture and identity came up. Good discussion.

Disassembled Christmas tree and packaged it. On the road to LA by 3:30
or so. Home by 7pm because of some construction traffic in TJ. Once
the Sun set, I needed some caffeine to stay awake at the wheel. More
food coma from the three border burritos I ate than
tiredness. Overshot it with half a canned yerba mate (14g sugar, 75mg
of caffeine from mixed sources). Chemical concoction. I'm WIRED.

Did laundry, made eggs for Leche and I. Mariana took a Rosca to
Paulina and David.

Going to try to sleep now.

Tomorrow morning: run, finish annual report, create letters for
friends and family, plan the week (Tuesday pick up special gift).

** Summary

Woke up at 5:10 but out of bed at 5:40am. Vivid dreams. Went for a run
and saw uprooted tree still on ground so drove back and got it. After
work, I potted it. Moved some soil from the front to the pot and mixed
perlite. Rooting agent brushed onto the base before burying. We'll see.

Got more polish on my side project done before work. Will start
sending friends the idea by EOM.

Design feedback on upload at SC. Drove to TJ at 7pm after picking up
Leche dog food then Mariana Panda Express. ATM and gas on the way
down. In TJ by 10pm (ish). Going to bed now, will read some of the
communication book. Running in the morning.

Good day. Rained hard last night so no early morning run. Did a short
one (0.6mi) with Leche around the block.

Attention divided after work but good energy today. Walked 3mi.

Found solution to the 404 problem.

Side project looks good. Will run tests the morning.

** Summary
Woke up at 5:50am and went for a 1.5mi run. Felt great. Deployed side
project before SC work at 8am. Booked half marathon for April 6th in LA.

Looking into options for total solar eclipse. Mazatlan direct is super
expensive but the benefit is we have a place to stay...might balance
out. Costs $4k if direct. Unless we leave on Sunday night and return
on Monday night (only $500)

SC work was focused.

One of my biggest goals this year has to be around my attention. If I
don't have something to do, I tend to get sucked into mindless
wandering or scrolling. It might serve an unconsciously healthy
purpose but it gets to the point of habit and it bothers me.

Bed time.

** Summary
New Years party at Setareh and Mehdi's house. Stayed until 1am or so,
back by 1:45am. Woke up around 9:30/10am. Vivid dreams but my
recording of them has fallen off. Pen next to bed

Lots of small chores today. Ran 1.5 loops around the block with
Leche. Skimmed mold off saurkraut, finance review for December and all
of 2024. Topped off oil. Made split pea soup and bagguettes. Short
workout after the run with Leche. Laundry.

Some side project planning but it feels fake/forced. Maybe it's just a
weak muscle. Short plan, execute. Short plan, execute. 6 weeks? 2 weeks?

While throwing the ball with Leche today, she picked up some smell of
a bite to eat under Travis and Jessica's car. She ate it before I
could see what it was. Stuck my hand in her mouth to fish it out but
wasn't there. Gave her a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and 8oz of
water to flush it out. Had to force her to drink it which is no fun
but was for her own good. She threw up a bit at first then throw up
food about 5min later. Poor Leche. All the paranoia because a dog
(Cash) in our neighborhood died because he ate some rate poison he
found on the street. Terrible. Better safe than sorry.

We watched The Truman Show after dinner because Mariana hadn't seen
it. Discovered this while playing the board game "Dixit" at Setareh
and Mehdi's house last night. Solid movie, still fun to rewatch.

Bed time. Going to meditate before sleep.

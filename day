** Summary
Good day. Rained hard last night so no early morning run. Did a short
one (0.6mi) with Leche around the block.

Attention divided after work but good energy today. Walked 3mi.

Found solution to the 404 problem.

Side project looks good. Will run tests the morning.

** Summary
Woke up at 5:50am and went for a 1.5mi run. Felt great. Deployed side
project before SC work at 8am. Booked half marathon for April 6th in LA.

Looking into options for total solar eclipse. Mazatlan direct is super
expensive but the benefit is we have a place to stay...might balance
out. Costs $4k if direct. Unless we leave on Sunday night and return
on Monday night (only $500)

SC work was focused.

One of my biggest goals this year has to be around my attention. If I
don't have something to do, I tend to get sucked into mindless
wandering or scrolling. It might serve an unconsciously healthy
purpose but it gets to the point of habit and it bothers me.

Bed time.

** Summary
New Years party at Setareh and Mehdi's house. Stayed until 1am or so,
back by 1:45am. Woke up around 9:30/10am. Vivid dreams but my
recording of them has fallen off. Pen next to bed

Lots of small chores today. Ran 1.5 loops around the block with
Leche. Skimmed mold off saurkraut, finance review for December and all
of 2024. Topped off oil. Made split pea soup and bagguettes. Short
workout after the run with Leche. Laundry.

Some side project planning but it feels fake/forced. Maybe it's just a
weak muscle. Short plan, execute. Short plan, execute. 6 weeks? 2 weeks?

While throwing the ball with Leche today, she picked up some smell of
a bite to eat under Travis and Jessica's car. She ate it before I
could see what it was. Stuck my hand in her mouth to fish it out but
wasn't there. Gave her a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and 8oz of
water to flush it out. Had to force her to drink it which is no fun
but was for her own good. She threw up a bit at first then throw up
food about 5min later. Poor Leche. All the paranoia because a dog
(Cash) in our neighborhood died because he ate some rate poison he
found on the street. Terrible. Better safe than sorry.

We watched The Truman Show after dinner because Mariana hadn't seen
it. Discovered this while playing the board game "Dixit" at Setareh
and Mehdi's house last night. Solid movie, still fun to rewatch.

Bed time. Going to meditate before sleep.

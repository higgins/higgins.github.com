Hurricane today. Rained heavily all day. Took Leche for short walk
when there was pause. Eggs and potatos for breakfast. Tea and
chocolate for me.

Mariana cleaned the kitchen floor while I listened to more of
"Psycho-Cybernetics" which I'm enjoying. Reminds me of the value of
these daily summary notes, which I've mentally given up on over the
last 5 months (mid March, I would guess, when the new job search
started).

Tomorrow is my first day at Soundcloud. I'll post a Tiktok video in
the morning to promote 24HHP. I'll update LI, post about the job and
send DMs to specific people who helped along the way. Before work,
I'll head to UPS to mail the packages (Turntable stuff and Mariana's
gift to Analeh)

Going to bed now and listening to more of PsychoCybernetics.

** Summary
Today was my last day at Turntable. Woke up at 7am, made Choco-Matte
and had call with Dad. Really good chat. Felt really relaxed all
day. Played with Leche and wiped the machine in the afternoon. New
Soundcloud laptop arrived in the morning and I set that up.

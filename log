** Summary

I woke up at 8am today and did DuoLingo before taking Leche on our
morning walk up the hill. Made a smoothie (whey, pb powder, beat root
powder, banana) and gave updates at standup.

Shipped the username change and a small change to push
notifications. Pinged AWS again after they dropped the ball on our
call. Responded to a few personal emails. Called Phoenix Hotel about
our arrival. Replied to browserless ceo about our usecase. Started
prototyping a modifyied puppeteer version of what we want.

Talked with Nenya, a coworker of Evan Purcell's about his new venture
and gave some advice. Took Leche on a few walks and threw the ball in
the afternoon. Had salad and fish for lunch. Gave Leche two pieces of
fish today.

Started packaging up privatize for homebrew distribution but didn't
finish before we headed to American Beautify for dinner with Marie and
Moti. We played the mobile app "Wavelength", a fun way to pass the
time. We were all pretty hungry so it was good to have something to
focus the mind.

The burger at Win-Dow is better. AB's is good but you need to be drunk
to really enjoy it. That or it needs some crunchy freshness. Eight of
a head of iceberg.

Came home, took Leche for a walk, did more DuoLingo and watched
another Halt & Catch Fire. Tired now, going to bed. I fell asleep
watching the show. I watch while lying on the ground because it feels
better on my back. Leche barked at some sound she heard outside and
wouldn't let up. She was offended we didn't let her check and
see. Good girl to bark though.

Tomorrow, I'm going to ship privatize make the encapsulate.me/log page
and write the posts. I'll do my chest workout if my back is feeling better.

Oh yeah, I woke up with a thrown back. How the heck did that happen?
Have I been slouching at the standing desk? Cheating while walking on
the treadmill? It was like I herniated it again. Super tight and slow
to make any moves.

** Summary

I woke up at 8am today and took Leche for our morning walk up the
hill. Returned and made a smoothie (whey, pb powder, beat root powder,
banana, fiber, water) for breakfast.

Deployed the latest API, reviewed wolfram's PR, integrated pubnub into
the app, added android verification and began reading browserless docs
after emailing their team on limitations of a beta feature of their
api.

Took Leche on several walks today and invited a few more people to the
walk on Sunday.

Waited until about 1/1:30pm to eat lunch. Put the rice, veggies and
fish in chicken broth for a quick soup. Was great but I think I waited
too long to eat, was pretty sluggish after. Maybe it was all that rice.

Had a few focusmate calls and one no-show.

After work I finished up the features for privatize. The sha-1 hmac as
IV solution works great. I renamed some of the commands and made it
work as a standalone tool for piping. Will add a terminal gif of its
use and publish in npm. Will start using it on this file and write a
renderer for it for viewing on
https://encapsulate.me/log?day=dd-mm-yyyy. That site will be a single
page that does the following:

- fetches this log file
- parses every day for the `Summary` section, excludes everything else
- if no `day` argument is supplied on qs, renders the current day's
  summary with any privatize'd data as blacked out censored text
- if the current day doesn't have a value, render "Justin hasn't
  submitted today's summary"
- show page toggles for: first, most recent, previous, next
  entry. Skips over any day that was not logged
- if a day doesn't have a value, render "Justin did not log this
  day". Only way people can see this is if they enter a date in the
  url manually. Show options for "would you like to see the entry
  closest to this date?"

Once done, talk about it:
- LinkedIn -- privatize
- Twitter -- privatize
- Twitter -- daily log
- LinkedIn -- daily log
- TinyLetter, encapsulate.me/writing, HN-- combo post

I'm going to bed now. Will wake up early and do my 5x5 chest workout
with added dips

** Summary
I woke up at 7am today and did my SL 5x5 workout. No more GVT until I
want to mix it in. Felt great all day after the 5x5. Started with low
weight but will step up faster than the +5lb rule. Had a smoothie
(whey, banana, pb, beat root powder) for breakfast with the
workout. Did my pushups during the workout.

Took Leche for our walk and made it back for standup at 9am. Finished
the banUser api and synced with James on real time solution. Moving
forward with pubnub. Also resolved some old issues while on the call
with him. Made the `usernameIsAvailable` api available to mobile app
too.

Had a big salad for dinner and watched Halt & Catch Fire with
Mariana. It's basically just a big character drama. Huge swings with
some of these characters.

After, I read some of crypto101.io to make sense of the SHA1-HMAC IV
that git-crypt uses. Swapped out my implementation for it and as I
thought, it doesn't work. I suspect it relies on getting the SHA from
git and not computed on fly. Need to comb through the source a bit
better.

Going on a walk with Leche and might watch another episode with
Mariana.

** Summary

I woke up at 8am today and took Leche for a walk up the hill. Came
back and made scrambled eggs with goat cheese. Leche got some too and
loved it.

Deployed some patches before our all hands test at noon. Scheduled
call with AWS support about the issue I filed yesterday.

Worked on some internal admin features.

Made foil fish with zuchini, peppers and onions.

Overcast and pretty cold today. Rained for a bit.

Did my 100 pushups while looking at an old bug ticket. Friggen tired,
going to bed soon. Will wake up early and start the 5x5 program
again. GVT is too straining right now

** Summary
Today I woke up at 7:50am and took Leche for her morning walk up the
hill. I made a whey protein, pb powder, beat root powder and banana
smoothie for breakfast.

Standup at 9am and deployed last Friday's code with Wolfram
driving. Fixed the issue he ran into last week on his build tools.

Small potatoes work today. Productionized the web client and moved
some static files from api to there.

Had lunch with Mariana at a poke place after finding out this ceviche
spot was closed. Went to the park to walk around after.

Spent the rest of the afternoon debugging why worker metrics weren't
reporting and emailed AWS support to investigate. Made a few config
changes to our queuing system in order to clear out the backlog of
running workers. I think it'll help with the "ancient workers" problem.

Sent Auntie Fran and Jacob a text nudge to remind them of the wedding
vows ceremony. Auntie Fran says she didn't get her invite which was a
bummer! Sent it in text to which she confirmed she and Uncle Ben can't
make it because of their 40th wedding anniversary.

However, Jacob and his partner are going which will be fun. Most of
Mariana's side can make it so it'll be nice for my family to meet more
of hers.

Took Leche on 4 walks today. Had mac & cheese for
dinner. Mixed in ground turkey from yesterday. Didn't stick to the
"only fish" rule on M-Th as the food was already cooked from yesterday
and it saved time in the day. Tomorrow, I'll freeze it and make up for
today with this weekend's meal.

Thought more about the IV problem in privatize. Not sure how git-crypt
is uses a sha1 hmac for the IV. If the encryption IV is based on the
contents of the unencrypted file, how can we get that for use as IV
for decryption? By that point, the file is already encrypted so you'd
have two different sha1 hmacs. I'm sure I'm missing something here.

Did my 100 push ups just now and wrote this. Will go to bed and
probably listen to binaural music as I drift off. Terrible dreams last
night, had me cloudy for the better half of the day.

** Summary

I woke up at 9am today and made some tea before heading out on the
Palms Puppy Pack walk. Mariana joined today. Largest crew yet:
Jonathan, Karla, Hind, Mariana, Lexi. Went on the same path. It was
pretty hot today. Went for an hour, got back and drank some ice water.

Went to Trader Joes to pick up food for the week and for the game day.

Mariana went swimming and I worked out. Did chest exercises (GVT,
bench, dips and pushups). I took a shower and started preparing the
food for the Super Bowl. Made turkey lettuce cups and "buddings beef"
rolls.

Game was fun, everyone had their computers out and half watched the
game and commercials. Half time show was entertaining too. Great that
the game was so close. LA won and a few fireworks were fired in our
neighborhood.

Marie stayed after for a while and chatted. Took Leche on her night
walk. Came back to write these notes.

Going to watch Halt & Catch Fire and go to bed. I'd like to start
running again and am leaning towards buzzing my hair at the end of
this year, pretty hot when its long.

Yesterday, I woke up at 9am and played with expo.io tools before
having a call with Jeff Zie to catch up and talk about his app. We met
on focusmate and when he was looking for a mobile engineer. At the
time, I couldn't pick up another contract but told him I would point
him toward others who could.

Had enough time to get a good feel for the expo tools and like what I
see. Need to test one more feature before deciding to go with it.

Went to the dog park with Leche and Mariana to meet her friends and
their dogs. We were there from 2pm-4pm. Leche is great at fetch and
return until other dogs are around. At one point she bolted across the
park to chase a squirrel up a tree. A horny dog kept following her
trying to hump incessantly.

We went to Ronan for dinner at 5:45pm. They sat us in stinker table
and I asked for another one. The food was not great. Focused more on
looks than taste.

Drove around for a minute before heading over to the Grove for our
movie night (West Side Story). On the way over, I changed lanes to
avoid a car who had stopped in the middle of the right lane. Signaled
and did so with enough notice for the car behind me. He got pissed and
drove to the oncoming traffic stopped at the light to yell all drunk
like through his window at me. Didn't engage, figured he was drunk or
high but he was unnecssarily angry for something he had complete
control over. He really wanted to fight too, drove backwards at the
light to roll up and yell stuff.

Walked around the grove and had an ice cream from an old fashioned
creamery. Walked some more to Zara where Mariana looked at
clothes. Made our way to AMC, got popcorn and water and Mariana got a
coke. The movie was long. Laughed when it first started because the
opening snapping fingers scene made me think of the angry gangster
driver doing the same to get his frustration out.

Came home, took Leche for a night walk and watched another Halt &
Catch Fire.

** Summary
Yesterday I woke up at 6:30am and got ready to take Leche for her
grooming appointment at 8:15am. We went on a short walk around the
block. She loved the trip to PetCo, sitting in the front seat.

Came back for standup and to deploy patch version of the api. Wolfram
drove and I navigated this time as we recorded for
posterity. Discovered his cpu architecture meant we need to change the
build and deploy scripts to get it working for him. He'll fix and
drive the next deploy too.

Focused on some bug fixes all day. Small but impactful. Gave my weekly
updates via whatgotdone.com

Leche played with Ziggy in our driveway for about 45min before
dinner. Good to catch up with Sam and Elle who've been very
busy. Invited them over for snacks on Sunday and to loosely watch the
SuperBowl.

Got `privatize` in a workable state for use but as I wrote the README
I realized I should re-write the encryption scheme. Basing this off
`git-crypt`'s note on security. I should ping that author when
done. Showed Tim and asked for his input.

Tomorrow, I'll have a call with Jeff Zie and get familiar with the
latest mobile react native tooling. We'll go to the park at 2pm and
then have a date night at The Grove (dinner and West Side Story).

** Summary
I woke up at 8am today after some pretty deep sleep. Took Leche for
our walk and made a smoothy for breakfast (whey protein, peanut butter
powder, frozen blue berries, half a frozen banana, beet root
powder...not my finest work).

AWS support replied and their answer fixed the metrics problem (silent
reserved variable name...what luck). Added the unit to the metrics and
problem solved.

Started to deploy new cluster for workers but didn't finish it before
call with Billy and then all hands where we tested the product. Its
getting there. Hoping by end of this month we'll have it ready.

Wrote a spec for how to deploy and will pair with Wolfram tomorrow
while he drives the deploy. He'll do the rest of the deploys until
after our wedding for bus factor and the share that responsibility.

Cousin Josh said he can't make it to the wedding which is a bummer but
good to hear from him. Ping Danielle Baskin on twitter to point out a
bug on one of her product pages. Pretty interesting work.

Threw the ball with Leche and took a walk after work. Fixed the
checkout problem on `git-privatize` and am nearly finished (still need
to get `git-unlock` working). Did my GVT legs and deadlift
exercises. GVT is great but I need to do it more often to feel the
progressive effects. At my current pace, its over a week before I do
the same exercises and I don't feel much stronger.

Unclogged the bathroom sink filled with hair. Nasty smell in those
pipes. Also, we've got a done of stuff hidden under the bathroom
sink. Reminds me of stat-mech or what Kevin Favro (approximately) said
one time: space gets filled.

Took a shower and tried on my wedding suit. It fits well. Kinda tight
in the knees but I think we'll be fine.

Made a tuna salad (lettuce, cabbage, arugula, cheese, tuna, almonds,
italian dressing) and watched Halt & Catch Fire episode. It's good,
but I'm looking forward to being done with it. Too much TV too fast.

We're going on a walk now and then to bed for early rise. Leche has a
bath tomorrow at 8:15am.

** Summary

I woke up at 8am today. 6:30am first but no goal in mind. I think
doing pushups within the first 3minutes of waking up would be good.

Did some Duolingo in bed before starting the day. Answered a question
in slack before taking Leche on a short walk around the block. Came
back to standup. Focus today was to figure out why ecs tasks were
falling over. API was getting marked unhealthy even though no logged
crashes. Hit the health check with 5rps to determine it wasn't falling
over due to our health check conditions. Figured that the shared
resources of workers were causing all tasks to
collapse/restart. Temporarily disabled that worker until I design a
better system to manage it.

Will see how the API has faired tomorrow during all hands test.

Made a shrimp + tofu curry over rice. Had a second slice of chocolate
babka today with Mariana while we watched Halt & Catch fire. Too much
cake in these last two days. That stuff is great but I got flush with
all that sugar. Went for a walk with Leche to clear it.

Worked on privatize and fixed the git diff issue. Need to figure out
whats going on with checkout, add an unlock feature and do some code
clean up before I publish.

Watched a Ted talk that was on my queue about mitochondrial
health. Basically eat more leafy greens. A goal like: "9 cups of leafy
greens per day" would be solid.

Nudged my family about the wedding date, got a few more replies.

Tomorrow, I'll design the new worker cluster so we are properly
isolated from API.

** Summary

I woke up at 7am today and did Duolingo first thing. I made a protein
shake with whey, peanut butter, banana and water. Soaked the oats
overnight. Made oatmeal for Mariana.

Did GVT OH press (10x10) and pushups. Watered the plants whilst. Quick
cold shower after. Took Leche on our morning walk. Returned to setup
CloudWatch metric filters and deploy patch version of API. CloudWatch
metrics are only partially configured, have a ticket for support to
address.

Our all hands was delayed till Thursday as there are some issues with
the build to address.

Had a salad with tuna for lunch.

Went to Sabrina's and Ulysse's for Ulysses's birthday. Dinner was
delicious and Sabrina made a great cheesecake too.

Left at 10:15pm and am going to bed now (11:00pm)

Tomorrow, I will wake up early and do my pushups asap.

I'd like to deconstruct the worker problems tomorrow after noting
taking some small issues off the backlog.

** Summary

I woke up at 7am today and made eggs for Mariana, me and Leche. It was
Mariana's first day of her new job and she wanted to get there by
8:30am. Her new office is super close in Culver City.

Took Leche on her morning walk before standup. A shorter walk since we
didn't have time for the full up the hill one. After standup I
deployed the latest APIs in production and debugged the chat issue
with James. There were a few issues we caught but it looks like
they're scoped to client-side changes. We'll test the new patch in
tomorrow's deep dive.

I found a new solution for the metrics problem using Cloudwatch
filtered metrics. At least I think I have. I need to prove it out
tomorrow morning before the all hands.

I did three batches of laundry throughout the day and picked up water
and groceries in my lunch hour. Bought the fancy water ($2/gal) this
time. Probably not worth it all the time but maybe once in a
while. We'll see if we can feel any difference.

I was pretty tired today after lunch. I didn't eat a whole lot. About
a 1.5 cups of cooked rice, 1 cup tuna fish + mayo and 1 cup
peas. Maybe too much sugar? This inspired the trip to TJ to pick up
some fiber powder, hoping that the lack of fiber is in my diet had
contributed to the lethargy. Will drink it before I go to bed and when
I wake up for a while. Also will eat more vegetables with every meal.

Made salmon, rice and mixed salad for dinner tonight. Salad dressing
was a homemade italian-ish dressing. Too garlic-y I think, but I'll
use less next time. Mariana had a good first day. She got put on CA
work which is great as it's what she's been looking for. The project
will take several years it sounds like and in that time she'll also
juggle smaller projects possibly.

We watched and episode of Halt & Catch Fire and are going to bed now
at 10:30pm.

Tomrrow, I'll wake up early exercise and have a protein shake. We'll
head to Sabrina & Ulysess' house for his birthday in the evening.

** Summary

I woke up at 8:30am today and did some duolingo on the toilet. I
wanted to wait to take Leche for her bathroom walk until we met up
with the neighbors for the weekly walk but she really had to go. Kiss
Mariana goodbye when she went to swim and took Leche to meet the
"Palms Puppy Pack".

We waited on the corner until 10:15 or so for everyone to show
up. Walked to Cheviot Hills and around the neighborhood. Good exercise
and nice to hear from the neighbors. We were back by 11:30 or so.

We got ready for our hike. Packed leftover salmon for Leche, made some
guacamole and packed them in a backpack with a jug of water. We went
to Lokal sandwich shop to pick up some bahn mi before heading to
Topanga Creek for the hike. The korean bbq bahn mi is pretty
good. Wasn't sold on their sandwiches until trying that one.

It took a while to get to Topanga creek. There was some volleyball
tournament or something going on in Malibu that cause lots of traffic
on the 1. Parked in our usual spot and made our way to the creek. It
was pretty overrun, moreso than usual. Walking on the side of the road
with Leche was a bit stressful. We made our way down the tunnel and at
the bottom, Mariana held onto Leche and handed her to me after I
climbed down. We had to pass her around like that a few times on our
hike/scramble to the swimming pond. She had a blast though. Would
anticipate where we were walking and find a path that made sense for
her. She loved it. Apparently she broke a nail sometime on our
scramble to the pond. Mariana was worried about her after seeing her
limping. We didn't know what the issue was but I saw that Leche was
mildly bothered by it. Figured she scratched the pad of her foot while
swimming.

We left the swimming pond after about 20 minutes because we missed the
sun. We hopped to find another smaller sunlit pond up the creek but no
luck. Instead, we drove up to Leo Carillo dog beach and stayed for a
few hours. It's not as liberal as Huntington beach is, allowing dogs
to run off leash but maybe there weren't that many people there. Leche
played fetch with a stick in the ocean and actually caught a big wave
once. She's not a big fan of the waves. If you throw the stick too
far, she look at you as if to say "you get it!".

We went back to shore to rest for a bit and get burried by an anxious
Leche who had to vent her frustration of not being able to chase every
dog or bird she saw by digging huge holes next to us. We played fetch
in the ocean a few more times before settling down to watch the sunset.

For the last 20min before the sunset she was particularly whiny. Any
bird would set her off. Mariana pointed out two dolphins who were
swimming next to shore. Amazing. They were less than 100 yards from us
and were maybe 40 yards from the water.

It took longer to get home than usual. Traffic on the 1. Listened to
Animal Collective's new album and some old tracks. Good vibes. I don't
know who said they are like the modern Beach Boys but today that fit
the bill.

I made shrimp pasta when we came back and we watched Halt and Catch
fire. One episode in the living room and another in bed where I write
this. I did my 100 push ups after dinner.

Tomorrow, I will wake up at 6:30am and do my shoulder/back
workouts. I'll also watch the rest of that egghead video on
chakra-ui. My focus in Glow will be to spec out a healthy long-running
worker system. It's Mariana's first day of work tomorrow. She's got
some butterflies but she'll do great. I hope the office space is
insipring and her coworkers and work environment are incredible.

** Summary

Today I woke up at 8:30am and took Leche for her walk. Ran into
another neighbor and his dog (Nick and Sam) and invited them on the
dog pack walk tomorrow. Invited a few more people throughout the day
too.

I made avocado toast and eggs when we got back. Leche got one egg. I
had a good catch up call with Tim. Bounced some ideas off of him and
caught up on our lives.

After the call I walked Mariana to studio to pick up some
items. Mariana worked on her pottery and I got a nearly complete first
draft of `privatize` done. Need to figure out the diff attribute.

We went to the dog park for Leche to run around. She was pretty
well-behaved considering it had been over a year since we've let her
off leash at the park (not beach). The dog attack last year had us
pretty cautious. Anyway, was very attentive to the ball and frisbee
but later got more interested in dogs.

Spent some time brainstorming some ideas for game idea I had. I don't
think it's worth building this year so I won't focus more sessions of
thought on it.

Ate Lonzo's (peruvian) for dinner and watched another Halt & Catch
Fire with Mariana. She trimmed more clay pots and I wrote some more
notes on the side project to launch later this year.

Did my 100 push ups before the note writing hour and now I'm writing
this. Time for bed.

Tomorrow, we'll go on our neighborhood dog walk and the go to Topanga
Creek to hike and swim.

** Summary
Caught up on sleep today and woke up at 6:30am but got out of bed at
7am. Did DuoLingo early (apparently you get a 2x points boost if you
do a lesson before noon). Took Leche on her walk and returned by
8:30am in order to drive to Trader Joes and CVS for the remainder of
Mariana's gift (batteries for latte stirrer, snacks from Trader Joes)

Had standup at 9am and noted the deploy would have some
downtime. Scheduled it for 5pm PT. Did a few "nice to have" features
and researched different Blue/Green solutions for workers.

This morning someone bought 10 units (at $10/unit) of
24HourHomepage. They emailed me to let me know the publish system was
broken. When I shipped the affiliate page I broke publish by including
picnic.css. During my lunch break I restyled the affiliate page by
hand and confirmed the publish system worked. I ate leftover salmon
for dinner.

After lunch, I made the "unlisted content" feature and got it to main
before the 5pm deploy. Deploy went mostly without a hitch but the
workers had to get patched because you can't trap SIGKILL in newer
versions of node. Was doing that to investigate Blue/Green solution.

Made zuccini, shrimp pasta and timed it for when Mariana got back. She
got her braces off and likes her teeth. Julieta cut her gums to make
them more aesthetic though I can't tell much difference. Her little
baby tooth is gone though. :(

We went to her pottery studio to pick up pots she made. Six or seven
this time. Great looking ones. We brought Leche to the studio. On the
way back, I held the pots and Mariana walked Leche. I get pretty
frustrated when Leche plays aggressive with Mariana jumping on her and
tugging the leash. Frustrating but nothing we can't work on. Sometimes
Leche just gets in these hyper "I need to play and I'm going to force
you to play" modes. We threw the ball earlier and she was great about
dropping it with treats to encourage her.

We watched two episodes of halt and catch fire and are heading to bed
where I write this. Leche is out our feet.

Tomorrow, I will wake up early do my pushups and review the roadmap
for the side project. Looking forward to catching up with Tim at 10am.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am today half awake already. The kind of awake like I
woke up at just the right moment of dream cycle, not actually
rested. I stayed in bed for another 30 minutes before starting my
workout.

Chest day. I started with dips and pushups superset because I was
fatigued on the dips last time. That meant today's bench was super
fatigued after the 10x10 ss set. Took Leche on a walk and bought a
dozen eggs and some tea for Mariana.

Mike noted there was an issue with user search. Fixed and focused on
the HUD today. Made a few small but significant changes to that system
that I'll deploy off hours tomorrow or Saturday.

Had a call with Islam to catch up and chat about 2022 goals. Pinged
Riley as he might be a domain expert for one of his ideas.

Had beatroot + whey protein with workout. Ate cheesy eggs and toast
for breakfast. Salmon, rice and potatoes for lunch and dinner. Leche
ate half a piece of salmon.

We went on a few walks around the block today. Leche was pretty eager
to play. Invited Sam & Elle over for Ziggy + Leche playtime but Ziggy
was pooped from daycare. Threw the ball with Leche for 10min or
so. The best way to get her to drop it is with snacks. I should get
bigger pieces of meat to treat her because she really doesn't like
giving it up.

Spent half an hour working on privatize but I'm wiped and am going to
bed now. Will shower first and call Mariana before passing out the
moment my head hits the pillow

** Summary
What a day. I woke up at 6:30am and again stayed in bed until
7:30am. I checked my notifications on my phone and saw James was
having some issues with the migration (and patch) last night. Ended up
spending the morning debugging that.

Before starting work though, I walked with Mariana to Commissary for
breakfast. I got a burrito and a matcha and was pretty alert from it
all day. The burrito there is amazing.

I hopped on our standup call and took notes for the team. Used
startingcondition.com which was a fun icebreaker. Took Leche on our
usual walk and returned in time to say goodbye to Mariana who is going
to TJ to take off her braces.

Thawed some salmon in the sink and continued debugging with James. Had
to make one patch this morning to a worker that was casting the wrong
type after the UUID work. Determined the issue was on client side.

Broke out the workers to run individually and gave them each
appropriate resources. Broke out the zombie system from one worker to
run as a standalone service. Will test it tomorrow. Before that,
investigated whether redis keyspace notifications would solve our
problem. They don't.

I baked the salmon then baked some potatoes and half a red onion in
the fish fat. At the salmon over rice with soy sauce. Potatoes are for
tomorrow. I gave Leche half a piece of salmon mixed into her bowl of
kibble.

I took Leche on two night walks. One at dusk and another after
dinner. I did my 100 pushups then spent this evening writing about a
new business I want to create on the side. I took three focusmate
sessions to get all the ideas out (some user stories, some
roadmapping). Pretty excited to work on it. There's a lot of work and
research to do before and I'll do it piecemeal in the early mornings
before I start my Glow responsibilities.

Tomorrow, I'll wake up and blast my pecs: GVT bench + dips, pushups +
farmer carry.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am today but then went back to bed for 30min before
getting up to do my workout. I made a beetroot powder and whey protein
shake with the breakfast. Leg workout today, still doing GVT though I
haven't had the energy to do the full 10x10 set for legs since the
first day. Maybe I had breakfast before that workout? The last two leg
days were on an empty stomach (minus the shake I consumed during) and
I was gas'd by halfway through it. Did my pushups superset with the
squats and part of deadlift.

I took Leche on our morning walk. Uneventful mostly. The apartments on
Motor Ave have taken down their scaffolding. The new face of that
building looks nice with fresh stucco and paint.

Prepared the migration on dev and communicated it with team. At our
weekly meeting we did an all hands use of the product and founds some
bugs. I fixed a few of them today.

At lunch I went to the bank to withdraw money for the Mexico wedding
tables & chairs. I made a shrimp fried rice for lunch. Pretty
tasty. Leche got a 6 pieces of shrimp in total today. We threw the
ball for a little bit on one of our afternoon breaks. She wasn't as
interested in trading the ball for treats today.

I walked with Mariana and Leche to her studio class and we took the
long route back (by the restaurants). Some people were eating outside
the pizza/italian shop on motor. Never seen that, thought the place
was mostly for deliveries.

I deployed the dev migration while Mariana was at her class. James
found a bug with an external dependency we didn't catch. Patched it
and redeployed.

Some news in email from family today. Not the best news but all things
considered, it could be worse and am thankful we've got each other.

Jason's dog apparently needed stiches in her ear. I'll get the details
tomorrow but he asked for how to get an emergency sitter

Scheduled all the email wedding invitations for tomorrow morning. Will
text Uncle John his since he doesn't use email.

My feet hurt. Leg day plus walking on treadmill. Might watch something
with Mariana in bed but I'm wiped and will fall asleep.

I write this in bed with Mariana holding Leche. <3

** Summary

I woke up at 8:30am today. Deep sleep from falling asleep to brain.fm
last night. I did wake up at 6:30am but caved and slept more. Tonight
i'm putting my phone further away so I can wake up for exercise.

Today was exhausting. Glow production is shipped and migrated. Had to
patch a config where we had configured a write node to with a
read-only setting. After that, started the UUID migration which has
gone on until now (10pm).

Took Leche to the pet store to pick up new food for her and some
dental treats. She loves the store and really, any car ride around
town. She's a great dog.

At sundown, took her with Mariana to her pottery studio to check if
any new glazed items came out. Returned where I fried up some kale and
left over chinese food to eat over rice.

I shared some ideas with Jeff Zie, who I met on focusmate a few months
ago. He's building a book app of some kind and I had offered to point
him in the right direction re mobile work.

I scheduled a call with Tim for Saturday. Been a while, looking
forward to that.

Tomorrow we finally get to send the wedding invitations out. It'll
take a while but I'll start in the morning after my exercise.

Tonight, I'm going to wind down with my 100 push ups and then read
more about type-graphql in bed before getting some shuteye.

** Summary
I woke up at 9:00am today and got ready for the neighborhood dog "pack
walk" with Leche. She was so excited. Pulled at the leash for nearly
the whole walk. Tired herself out about halfway through though
(pulling uphill is hard). Leche loved to lead and kept turning around
to see if her friends were following her. Zella, the dog who inspired
the group dog walk, was opening up with all the other dogs
around. Sweet dog.

I had a beet root, protein powder, banana and egg smoothy before the
walk. Also ate 3 hardboiled eggs before the walk.

After about an hour we were back home and Leche was overjoyed to tell
Mariana of her walk. Jumped on the bed, burried her face in the
blankets.

Mariana got ready for our day at the beach. I through the ball with
Leche for a bit. I now bring small treats to encourage her to drop the
ball when she returns it. It works, mostly but sometimes she is too
obsessed with chewing the ball to drop it.

We went to venice and parked on the road because I forgot to bring
cash. No trouble finding parking. Camped out just on the other side of
the big dune on the sloped hill. Good sun but coldish wind. Cold for
LA, it wasn't that bad.

I brought the mineral sunscreen in a small jam jar. Its pretty
thick. Takes some time to apply properly. I did a little duolingo and
started to read "Como Agua con chocolate" but didn't make it very
far. Needed to look up lots of words and didn't have the patience to
do that while battling the wind.

We stayed for two hours or so then went to the "Win-Dow" for
lunch. Mariana got two small fried chicken sandwiches (ate one) and I
got a kale salad and fried chicken sandwhich. The sandwhich is good
but needs hotsauce. With hotsauce, it'd be like a 9/10. Without, maybe
its a 6 or 7.

Came home to take Leche for a walk and play bacci ball on the lawn. I
got an early lead, Mariana caught up but I won. Some neighbors we
didn't know gave a "I hope she wins!" cry as they walked past with
their baby.

Before the game started I chatted with our neighbor Chris who works at
the SoFi stadium in LA which is hosting the Superbowl this year. He
said the NFL basically commandeered all operations but require a
subset of existing staff to participate. There was some bureaucratic
non-sense about not letting those who don't need to be there be
there. Who wouldn't want to work the superbowl?

Had leftover soup Mariana ordered from the Chinese restaurant. It
wasn't very good, kinda cheap noodles and broth. I added leftover
salmon for some protein. I think I'll eat more lettuce this week, not
enough leafy greens lately.

I sent about 10 or so messages to artists about joining
24HourHomepage. It felt good. I think 5 a day, in the morning, is a
reasonable goal while I am juggling full time work. I also sent a
LOOONG overdue update to existing 24HourHomepage customers and
affiliates. I asked them if they'd be interested in an embedded
version of the site on their website/newsletter. I'll only build it if
some say they would install it.

Tomorrow, I'll take my leg day workouts in the morning. Take Leche on
a walk and briefly test the production infra (user create). Big goal
tomorrow is to get UUID feature written and tested. Will need to get
Leche more food at lunch.

** Summary
I woke up at 8:30am today and took Leche for a walk. The neighbor
(Hind) and her skidish dog (Zella) followed us on our walk up the hill
to help socialize Zella. On the route we me another neighbor (Neil,
owner of Charlie) and invited him to a regular dog "pack" walk. We'll
do our first one tomorrow with Jonathan and Inez. Neil said he can't
make it tomorrow.

Had breakfast (4 eggs, toast, strawberries, tea) with Mariana. Tough
talk about family (the recent chat with my brother). Spoke of
different futures of living in LA and plans to save. Good
talk. Mariana went to swim with Paulina and I worked on Glow.

I fixed the EC2 autoscaling issue on dev and deployed prod. Saw that
ec2 stabilized in both enironments but the workers were restarting
every 90 seconds or so. Turns out, I built the image with the dev
envs. Redeployed and everything is smooth on that env.

We went to Nordstom Rack to find a black tie, black shirt for the
wedding. Got a tie and belt but will get the shirt in TJ. Mariana got
some shoes and a shirt for her new job.

Stopped at Target for Mariana to get some more clothes for the job. I
stayed in the car and practice Spanish en Duolingo. Came home worked
for a bit more before watching a few episodes of Halt and Catch
fire. Heading to bead now where I'll fall asleep and Mariana will tell
me about the rest of the show in the morning.

Tomorrow, I'll do leg exercise in the morning then go on the "Palms
Puppy Pack" walk at 10am. We'll head to the beach for a few hours if
its nice out.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am today but was in a zombie mode reading. Took Leche
on our walk at 8am, she was pretty sluggish for most of the walk.

Goal today was to get the full production stack up but had some
interrupts because the worker wasn't running. When we cut over to the
api subdomain, we didn't update an env var referencing that URL and
the workers didn't fail gracefully. Patched that and learned that our
dev system is severly under resourced. That's fine for now since
production is coming online where we won't be as constrained.

Once it is up, we'll need to run audits to see how many concurrent
users can do a particular feature. Some possible improvements there on
resolving lack of heartbeats. Look into redis notifications when a
document is expired.

Also, discovered that our autoscaling groups were confirgured
wrong. Going to fix that tomorrow while no one is on the sytem.

Took Leche on a few walks. She got to see the neighborhood pig
(Ramona) again. She was excited nearly the whole time, trying to run
over for play. Ramona wasn't having it. Leche didn't bark this time
but still room for improvement in her approach.

Speaking of which, there is a lady in our neighborhood who is training
her dog insanely well. This 60lb dog sat ONTOP of a fire hydrant
wating for her owner. She gave her paw to shake while balancing on the
hydrant. Alternated paws.

I sold the "Bartisian" machine Mariana got as a white elephant gift
that neither of us use. $180 to someone on craigslist.

We ordered chinese for dinner and started to watch "Halt and Catch
Fire" a show about a computer company in Texas in the 80s.

Going to watch one more HCF episode before sleep. Tomorrow I'll fix
the ECS deploy issue, start messaging on 24HourHomepage again.

** Summary
I woke up at 6:30am today but was in deep sleep. I spent about 20min
writing down my dreams while on the toilet. My workout started at
about 7am. I had beetroot powder mixed with whey protein powder.

I did two supersets: A) 10x10 pullups, 10x10 ring rows, B) 10x10
overhead press, 10x10 pushups. Felt good to mix in body weight
exercises, will do again.

Today I started to deploy our production infrastructure. I had to
pause that work to investigate an issue with dev. Apparently the
cloudwatch metrics lib was causing workers to crash. Reverted the
offending commits and will readdress after prod is up. A few more
services to deploy tomorrow.

Had some rough chat messages with Joey. Hoping that we'll talk again
in the future. That was on my mind for most of the day, will mediate
before sleeping.

Felt noticeably more distracted today. I suspect because of the
difficult messages earlier. Possibly also because deploying the new
infrastructure leaves plenty of idle time.

Before sleep, I'm going to change the styling on startingcondition.com
(so it looks okay on mobile), take Leche for a walk and then take a
shower.

Oh! On my walk with Leche this morning she took a huge poop that got
stuck to her butt. She couldn't pinch it so, with the bag, I helped
her but jeez was that a mistake. Poop everywhere. Came home to wash
her with soap and water.

** Summary
I woke up at 8am today. 6:30am came and went. Again, didn't set a goal
for the morning so didn't wake up to do it. Tomorrow I will wake up at
6:30am and do my weight exercise (superset: 10x10 pull ups + air
squats, 10x10 oh press + ring rows)

The cloudwatch problem was solved instantly with fresh eyes: the task
needed to declare the network bridge. After some IAM roles
back-and-forth, tested that it worked and deployed it.

The remainder of the work day was spent estimating sizing for
production. Wrote a proposal that I'd like to build tomorrow.

Mariana and I had lunch at the neighborhood thai place. I ate crab
fried rice as I'm only eating fish M-Th this year. It might be the
best lunch dish in the neighborhood. Not too heavy and delicious.

My back was strangely tight all day. Slept on it wrong I think. After
work, I hung upside down for about a minute, maybe less. It's been a
while since I've done it. Great mental training too. I did my 100 push
ups before going outside.

I called my Mom who was feeling sick yesterday from the second
vaccination dose. She's feeling better today. Left a voicemail for
Joey and will text tomorrow morning.

Kinda wiped so I'm going to draft ideas for a 24HourHomepage
embeddable ad and go to bed in order to wake up early! After the
workout tomorrow, I'll take Leche on a walk and start drafting my new
outreach plan.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am today. Actually, a about 5 minutes before. Leche
was trying sneak on the bed as she does when the sun is about to
rise. She wasn't very stealthy so I pushed her off. My phone was in
the other room and I hoped it was still early morning in order to
catch a few more hours of sleep. Five minutes later or so the alarm
went off.

Anyway, I was energized enough to start the day with a workout. I made
a protein, beatroot, banana, oatmeal, eggwhite smoothy and started my
chest workout. I moved the blender into the laundry room so as to not
wake up Mariana.

I superset bench press 10x10 at 130lbs with Ring dips 10x10. I
couldn't do the dips to completion but it was better than the last
time I did them. I finished the workout with 4 sets of 25 reps of pushups.

I walked to 7/11 to get milk for Mariana. She threw a mini tantrum
about not having milk last night for cereal or cookies. I got home by
7:55am and took a shower. Leche didn't want to go on our morning walk
but eventually she got out of bed. We went up the hill, she did two
big poops and she went back to bed.

This morning I finished some polish work for Glow and researched
cloudwatch metrics. We had our all hands and look close to launch. I
deployed the latest API. Cloudwatch metrics need an agent running
with each api. Investigating that tomorrow.

I felt great nearly all day. The great feeling of migrating off
rewardful, waking up early and blasting my pecks. Good energy.

Had some chats with Mariana about seating arrangements for summer. I'm
not going to stress about it until we get RSVP. It is silly to do the
planning when each RSVP yes/no changes the arrangement. It's fun,
yeah, but it's wasted effort until we know who is coming.

Help Mariana carry two pots to the kiln for firing. Cooked some frozen
shrimp to eat with leftover Berkeley Bowl stirfry for dinner. Leche
got 3 shrimp mixed into her food.

We walked to the pottery studio to pick up Mariana for the night and
returned to watch the last episode of Ozark season 4 part 1. Going to
bed at 10:45pm though I may put on some meditative music to helpf fall
asleep.

** Summary
I woke up at 8:30am today after not sticking the 6:30am landing. I'm
going to move my phone to the other room. When I keep it in the room
within arm's reach, I pretty regularly wake up just to tap it to
sleep. No bueno.

After standup I deployed the waitlist site with Albert. Some back and
forth to get the terraform config right. Great tool.

Walked with Mariana to her clay studio to pick up the rest of the
wedding gifts. They look great. Folks are going to love them.

Worked on some other polish tasks before the work day was done. Went
to Trader Joes to pick up a curry sauce, ended up getting the week's
groceries too.

Made a veggie curry with like 5 vegetables. I honestly don't know
which vegetables go well with each other but know that beyond a 5 in a
curry it runs the risk of getting muddled crazy flavor.

This was great though. Added super firm tofu and ate over rice.

On the way back from Trader Joes, found $10 bill in our
driveway. Yoink.

From about 7pm till 10:30pm I coded up, tested and migrated off of
getrewardful.com. Fine to use that service for a little bit but better
to manage myself (no cost).

It's almost 11pm now, I'll take Leche for a walk and wind down for
bed. I'd like to wake up and do my chest workout early tomorrow
morning.

** Summary

Today I woke up at 8:30am naturally after going to bed around 2am. We
had friends over for pizza party and stayed up late talking with them.

I made a beat powder + protein powder + banana + milkshake for
breakfast. Made scrambled eggs with bellpeppers, zuccini and cheese
for Mariana and I.

We took Leche on her long walk up the hill.

We went to Venice for an afternoon at the beach. First to Ray Ban
store to pick up some sunglasses for me for the wedding. Mariana wants
them for outside pictures I think.

We parked the car and walked to the beach where there was a new huge
sand dune made. Kids were sliding their boogy boards down it. Others
were running down it into the ocean. Kids loved it.

I took a short nap with my shirt on my face and meditated to binaural
tone. Marie joined us and chatted with Mariana for a few hours.

We left around 5pm with plans to meet Simon at 6pm. Mariana stopped at
Everlane first to buy some new shoes and pants for her new job.

I took Leche on a quick bathroom walk before heading over to Simon's
with her.

We got to Simon's and set up Catan before ordering our takeout
food. Cuban. Simon and I got bistec de pollo and Mariana got ropa
vieja. We returned to eat and play our first game. Simon won in a blow
out. We went to his apartment's jacuzzi. After 10min or so, other
neighbors joined us. We stayed in the jacuzzi for about half an hour.

We returned to see a happy Leche greeting us. We played another game
of Catan. This board was more fairly distributed. I had a strong lead
for most of the game and would have ended it earlier had Mariana not
pulled a sneaky move to intercept my vision of longest road. It set me
back but eventually I got it from her and won the game.

We returned home where I took Leche for another short walk and we
emptied and loaded the dishwasher. I did my 100 push ups, typed this
summary and am about to take a shower before heading to bed. We'll
watch one episode of Ozark in bed.

Also, early today my Dad emailed me an email with "Alex is okay, but"
subject. I thought it was a revival of a thread from last year where
he got into a rear end accident. It was not. He broke his left arm
pretty badly while snowboarding. No bueno. He's okay after surgery and
is resting at the Mt House now. Glad he's okay.

* 01/22/2022
** Summary
Woke up around 8:30am today after staying awake until around 1:30am to
watch the first four episodes of Ozark season 4. We capped it at 3
episodes but then were talking in bed and couldn't sleep for a few
hours so we watched one more episode. Made it nearly through all of
the last episode without falling asleep.

Made a beatroot + banana + milkshake for breakfast and had 4 scrambled
eggs. Made 3 fried eggs, 2 for Mariana and one for Leche.

I hopped on a focusmate call to do the 2022 goals paperwork. It took
maybe 2.5 hours, maybe less, to get all the cards written. Next year,
it'd be good to get a label maker system or make it all digital with
some nice physical touch. Something easier to automate but with a nice
touch.

Mailed all the dollars for the addresses I knew about. Leche enjoyed
the new walk we took.

Came home and cleaned the stove top, kitchen counters and bathroom
sink before guests arrived. Got to diddy with the guitar for a bit
before chopping veggies for the pizza party.

Did my 100 push ups then took a quick cold shower. My energy levels
were somewhat low, Mariana commented on it a few times. Mostly from
the junk food I had last night (milkshake and popcorn), lack of sleep,
and feeling like the yearly goals work ate up too much of the day.

The party was fun and the pizza was good. It was pretty loud
sometimes, even with music off or low, with everyone shouting their
conversations at each other. Maybe two or three simultaneous
conversations.

We chat for a few hours before I got out some dice to play "sixes" for
one round. After that, we played Exploding Kittens for two
rounds. Everyone loved the game. Less so the second round since people
were getting tired and their tempers short.

I took Leche out twice during the Exploding Kittens games. Once for
pee, once for poop. She has started going to the laundry room to
indicate she needs to go out. Odd since we exit through the front door
nearly all the time.

Going to bed after the guests leave. Tomorrow, we'll go to the beach
for a bit, buy some sunglasses for me (for the wedding), check out
some clothing stores for Mariana's new job then head to Simon's in the
evening for Settlers of Catan and jacuzzi. We'll pick up empanadas for
Empanada Place

** Summary
I didn't stick the 6:30am wake up this morning. I went through the
dream leveled justification of "I can do my workout at lunch", "I
already missed yesterday's early alarm what's another day?". No bueno.

Still, it was pretty lame I didn't do my workout early morning. No
guarantee I can get the workout in at lunch time (and I was pretty hungry).

Built a lot of glow features today. forceLogoutUser, fixed displayName
on search, started the zombie proc problem (2/3 done)

Did my workout and laundry during lunch. Did half of GVT (10x5) on
legs, just squat and deadlift.

Had a good call with Chase, to catch up and talk 2022 goals. Nice to
hear from old friends.

Booked hotels for our weddings (in SF and Tecate) and my Mom's flight
from PDX to SFO. Did my 100 pushups while waiting for Mariana.

Walked with Mariana to 7/11 so she could pick up milk and cereal for
dinner. I had left over salad and salmon.

It's 8:30pm now, I'm going to work on the affiliate migration and
finish up laundry before bed.

** Summary
Today I woke up at 6:30am...then went back to bed... again! Went to
bed around 11-11:30pm or so but no excuse. Just unfocused morning
workout routine and not looking forward to blasting my legs. Will
continue this 3 times per week GVT program until March wedding though.

Had our standup at 9am where two new features were requested from
team. Built both of them today and cleared a few backlog tasks.

Had the shrimp + cabbage for lunch and a couple focusmete
sessions. Mariana got her second offer from the company she
interviewed at accepted a few hours later. Some back and forth
conversation with her about accepting the offer. Her gut was to say
yes but she wanted to talk out some of that decision.

I threw the ball with Leche in our driveway for a few minutes before
we had to head out to pick up our rings. Drove back and started
preparing dinner for Marie who just moved into town (Venice). We
discussed officiating our wedding. Mariana has a few hard rules for
that day which I'll respect.

Took Leche for a walk, came back did my 100 push ups and got Marie on
board for the 2022 yearly goal challenge.

Getting ready for bed though I may work on privatize for a bit.

** Summary

I woke up today at 6:30am but didn't stick it. Went back to bed for
2.5 more hours and finally got up at 9am. Not great. I need to give
myself more time to rest after returning home from a trip, I
underestimate the time to return to return.

Worked on fixing CORS for Albert on Glow as he was blocked. Discovered
an issue with our infrastructure which I patched during our all-hands
then scheduled a larger fix for 7pm-8pm later. The actual fix took
about 80minutes to fix because I had to destroy several AWS resources
before spinning up new ones.

I mailed the remainder of our wedding deposit to SF City Hall and
talked with Mariana about her job offers and prospects.

Sat down a few times today as returning to the standing desk treadmill
after 5 days off (and no exercise) was tiring. The knees feel it first
for some reason.

Had some fake chicken nuggets for lunch and a couple cucumbers. Made a
shrimp stir fry (green and purple cabbage, carrots, shrimp, garlic,
ginger) for dinner.

Took Leche on a walk to pick up Mariana from ceramics. On the walk we
passed a dog owner with his dog on a date outside Madre the mexican
restaurant. I stopped before passing with Leche and asked if it was
safe to pass the doberman who looked set on attacking Leche. He said
"yeah, he's friendly" but then had to pull him off as he lunged toward
her. Not cool.

Came home to wind down. Doing my push ups now before we finish the
last episode of MindHunter and hit the hay.

** Summary

I woke up later today, probably around 9:30am or so. It's MLK day so
we had the day off and took advantage of that by sleeping in. I shared
the Spanish version of Wordle with Mariana and Maru. They both liked it.

I took Leche on her morning walk and returned to eat an omelette Maru
had made. 3-egg with asparagus and bell peppers and a chipotle cream
sauce. Delicious.

Dropped my car off to get it washed. Maru had a coupon which
apparently made it free.

I was a bit dizzy this morning. Odd. Not from any motion or
activity. Just a persistent feeling of dizziness for about 90minutes
in the morning. I was kind of worried by it so had a cup of black tea
thinking the vasodialating effects of caffeine would help. Maybe they
did. Maybe it was psychosomatic.

Afterward we went to pick up shoes for the wedding from BBB. Found
some nice ones with a squared/round toe. Mariana noticed a suit vendor
on our way out and said we should check it out. We went to Samborns
first to check if they sold the Spanish version of "Watch ya Mouth"
(the game we played during the holidays). They didn't. Went to a Torta
shop afterward. Had a milanesa which was too rubbery for my
tastes. Split flautas with Maru also who agreed they were too cold.

We went to the suit vendor afterward and tried on three suit
sizes. Two suit styles total. After much back and forth we bought the
all black suit with a white shirt. It will be slightly altered to make
the waste tighter and the legs longer. Suit, shirt and pocket square
were all less than $200 USD. Everyone was pretty impressed with
that. At that price I could wear a suit every day.

Returned home to pick up the car. Didn't know the coupon was for a
free service (I figured a discount). Returned home and packed car to
head back to LA.

Got back around 8:30pm and took Leche for her night-time walk. Had two
gorditas, about a cup of blueberries and two glasses of milk for
dinner.

We watched two episodes of MindHunter and have one remaining. Will
watch that this weekend probably.

Tomorrow, I'd like to wake up to do another leg day exercise and then
do the next task on the rewardful migration.

* 01/16/2022
** Summary

Today I woke up at 9:30am for breakfast with Mariana's
family. Breaksfast was scheduled for 11am so everyone showed up at
noon. We had gorditas from "Las Delicias" the breakfast spot we
love. Delicious.

Everyone stayed and chatted until about 4pm. Rafaella, Mariana's
neice, is crawling now and like to climb the stairs. We climbed with
her to make sure she didn't fall. She like feeding Leche crackers. I
took her to look at the other dogs (from through the screen
door). They seemed fine with her but when I bent down with her to wave
at them, they barked and scared her. Close call, nobody likes to make
baby cry.

Took Leche on a walk after everyone left and then stayed downstairs
and played with node's crypto package to encrypt streams from stdin. I
think I have all the pieces to make privatize. Some code
organizational questions to answer first (where does the key live?
user specified? an ignored dot file?

We had comida china for dinner. Noticably as good as Americanized
Chinese food. Took Leche on another walk to see if she would poop (did
not). Returned and did the dishes.

Going to watch more MindHunter before bed

** Summary
I woke up at 8:30am today after attempting to watch a few episodes of
"Mindhunter" in bed last night with Mariana. Didn't get very far
before falling asleep. Pretty vivid dreams again.

We drove to Tecate to book the wedding venue for June. Met the event
manager who seemed more professional in person than over email. Drove
back to TJ, more traffic than usual.

Stayed at the house for a bit before going to Analeh's parents house
for an asada. Delicious meat, not sure what (if anything) it was
marinated in but muy sabrosa. We played simple game of chance called
"contento" where in you are dealt a card and have the choice to either
keep the card or switch with the person to your right unless you are
the last person in the turn in which case you can keep yours or switch
with the top card in the deck. The lowest card loses. Simple rules and
fun for the whole family.

The power went out in playas and so we talked by candle light for a
while. Around 10:00pm we packed it up and went home but were invited
to hang out at the airbnb for a bit before heading home. First we
brought Leche but then were unsure how she would be with the two dogs
at the house, so we brought her back. The airbnb was right around the
corner, so nbd.

One of the dogs at the airbnb was obsessed with playing fetch. He
wouldn't take no for an answer, kept dropping his ball in Alan
(Analeh's boyfriend) lap. I wanted to tire the dog out so through it
12 consecutive times before the dog tapped out.

We returned at midnight and might watch a show before bed, not much
obligations tomorrow other than breakfast at the house. Lazy Sunday.

I woke up at 6:30am today but re-set it for 7:15am. I think in order
for this rise before sunrise thing to work I need to declare what I
need to do within the first 15minutes of my alarm going off. There are
also services like BeeMinder which will take your money if you don't
do your stated goal.

Worked on Glow all day, had a call with half the team about the zombie
problem. Turns out the chat based solution won't work since we can't
add an SDK to a widget. We've got a possible solution but will need to
prototype one thing next week to see it through. It might mean two new
(hairy) systems on the backend.

Had a delicious chipotle cream salmon with rice for dinner. Talked
with Pablo about different sales projects.

Returned upstairs to finish the deploy. While it was deploying did
some product research and responded to emails.

The rest of tonight and (parts of this weekend), I'll work on the
rewardful migration.

** Summary

Woke up at 6:30am but didn't have a plan so walked around the house
and went back to lie in bed to recall my dreams. Didn't
work. Eventually got out of bed at 7:15am, did a DuoLingo session and
responded to two pings at work.

Took Leche on a walk, ate frittata from yesterday and cottage cheese +
blueberries. Added some cottage cheese to Leche's food, she ate it
right up.

Had a call with Kevin Favro to discuss 2022 goals. Great to catch up
with him. Worked on Glow features (waitlist, zombie X problem) and
unblocked the zombie problem. Will test that on Friday.

Went to the bank at lunch to withdraw cash for the wedding deposit on
Saturday.

Packed and was on the road for TJ by 6:30pm. Arrived around
9pm. Stopped at Jack in the Box and ate chicken strips and fries for
dinner. Good but pretty oily, would've been nice to have some clean
food to degrease my mouth.

Took Leche for a poop walk when we got to TJ. Spent about 40min on
DuoLingo in bed and forgot to check-in this daily summary.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am this morning and did my DuoLingo sessions while
waking up. I started my workout by 7:15am and finished by
8:15am. Another GVT (10x10) chest day, this time I superset my
exercises and tried to do a 4010 rhythm for the bench. I dropped the
weight to 100lbs so that I could do the full volume without hitting
failure. Not bad at all, chest wasn't nearly as on fire as last time.

Had beetroot powder mixed in water again. Maybe that helped with
indurance too.

Had about 30min before work to work on a 24HourHomepage feature (react
form to post affiliate data). Hoping to get some time on Saturday to
finish it up before deploying next week.

Finished out the waitlist Glow features.

At lunch hour I refilled our water and bought some fruit from Trader
Joes. Confirmed with venue that handing them money (and get receipt)
is best route forward (bank account number they gave was missing one
digit).

Threw the ball with Leche after work and went on a few walks with her
today. Going on one more right now before bed.

Will read more of crypto101.com (research `privatize`) for before
going to sleep.

** Summary

I woke up this morning at 6:30am. A bit easier today even though legs
are still jelly from yesterday's leg workout. Had beetroot powder in
8oz of water on an empty stomach. Noticeable flushness in chest, not
as strong as I antcipated though. Beet "juice" wasn't as bad as I
thought. Did my 100 push ups early and DuoLingo early too.

Before work I started to migrate off Rewardful for
24HourHomepage.com's affiliate program. It's too expensive and hasn't
yielded the right results for cost. I emailed their team with an
offer: let me use the product for free in exchange for 5% percent of
each affiliate sale made. They replied quickly and seemed kind of
upset from the tone of their reply.

Took Leche on her walk at 9:00am. Worked out Glow features (spec'd out
waitlist and started work on APIs).

Asked Jered & Jacqueline for suit recommendations; they gave some good
ones.

At lunch, went to bank to pick up cashier's check for wedding.

After work sold old surfboard I bought two years ago (prefer the big
beginner boards we have).

Made pan salmon and roasted brussel sprouts for dinner. Caught up with
Tony Askar for a while about life and 2022 goals. Nice to catch up.

It's 9:30pm and I'm pretty wiped again. Gonna hit the hay.

Tomorrow morning I'd like to get a functional (unstyled, posting to an
api) affiliate form working before work.

** Summary

Today I woke up at 6:30am and started my workout by 7:15am. Pretty
zombie like for the first 45min of the day. Not really tired just
waking up. Sort of dragging my feet to do the 10x10 lifts.

I didn't do 10x10 leg day but did 5x10 (5 sets, 10 reps) of squat
(120lbs), bulgarian split squats (bodyweight), deadlift (120lbs) and
one leg "bow-erianas" (bodyweight). Took Leche on a walk before work.

Deployed last weeks features and hit the backlog. Got three small
tasks done and commented on a few features. One big one: we may need
some video processing on the backend. TBD.

My legs were jelly today after the workout. Threw the ball with Leche
in the driveway for a bit.

Re-watched part of Matrix 4 while eating dinner.

Passively researched a new product.

** Summary

After watching two episodes of Mindhunter until 1am last night, we
slept in until 10am, well rested. Took Leche on a short walk to the
ATM. She had already gone on her bathroom walk with Leo earlier.

We went to "Las Delicias" for desayunos. I ordered chiliquiles rojos
con dos huevos y una gordita con carne on the side. Delicious. Maybe I
just order the gorditas next time, 3 of them.

After that, we came home and had tea before packing to return to
LA. We filled up on gas and the lady who pumped the gas managed to
fill it up way past the original auto-stop of the pump. From 725 pesos
to 950 pesos.

The drive back to LA was pretty fast. Listened to several planet money
podcasts while Mariana and Leche slept. When we got home, we took
Leche for a walk and watched more Mindhunter (the rest of season 1)
until 12:00am.

It's a gripping show but I'm glad it's only two seasons.

** Summary
(Writing this on 01/09/2022)

I woke up without an alarm clock around 10am or so. Great feeling to
have every now and then.

A nice lazy day. Took Leche for her morning bathroom walk. Returned to
eat a spinach and cheese omelete. Had an fresh squeeze orange juice
with the meal.

Made an 10oz cup of gingko biloba tea and chat with Maru while Mariana
got ready to go meet the wedding photographer downtown.

Photographer (Valeria) was very friendly and asked lots of questions
about us and the day of. Paid our deposit and will pay the rest on
wedding day.

Returned to Playas, took Leche for another walk and to ATM before
heading out for dinner and the nights entertainment: an old singer
friend of Maru's giving a performance with her band. Sang mostly 60s,
70s, 80s songs en Ingles. We were early and walked around downtown for
a little but returned to wait in the car where it was warmer.

Before the show we ate at cevicheria "Nice". Delicious. I think I
should only get the tuna tostada from now on. It's insanely good. The
tacos were pale in comparison (and I tried 4 different types)

After a few hours (maybe a dozen songs) we returned home to an excited
Leche who I took for her night walk. We started to watch "Mindhunter"
a Netflix show I'd heard good things from David Fincher fans.

Watched two episodes before falling asleep. At some point in the
second episode Maru spilled Mariana's hot chocolate she rested on the
headboard. We paused to change the sheets and clean the chocolate
mattress stain.

Went to bed around 1:30am. Leche slept in Maru's room on top of Maru.


*** Food

Spinach, cheese, omelette with avocado and tomatoes on the side. 2.25
tuna tostadas, 1 taco pescado (frita), 1 taco de camerone, 1 taco de
pulpo "chicharon", 1 taco de marlin.

*** Drink
8oz orange juice, 10oz te gingko biloba, 8oz te verde, 12oz clamato
sin cerveza, 12oz agua mineral

*** Fitness
Dog walks

Need to figure out what the 100 push ups challenge is if I intend to
do serious chest routines. I think I just do it anyway or give myself
a few options to choose from (100 push ups OR 100 air squats OR 5 min
mountain climbers)

** Summary
Today I woke up at 7am for call with Dad, had to reschedule due to
extreme weather in Oregon (power outage). I could have stayed up then
but slept in until 9am. Really deep sleep these last few weeks. Maybe
the cold, maybe the post goal rest? Stopped listening to those
binaural beats and I'm still getting great rest. Awesome.

Finished most of the the "polishing" glow feature today. Need to sync
with Charles tomorrow about some edge cases.

Had the "Rosca de Reyes" party tonight. Mariana hecho dos roscas y
eran delicioso. Yo recibi el bebe y necessito pagar para las tamales
(o la fiesta proxima?). We ate frijoles, tamales y papas. Delicous.

Took Leche on her evening walk. Lots of protective dogs in the
neighborhood. Some are so jacked up they look like they'll bust full
out the gate that holds them to get Leche. She was only afraid of the
big pit bull looking ones (maybe because of her pitbull incident).

Came home and am going to bed early.

Yesterday I...

Yesterday finished the Glow feature and had mostly focused, good
energy throughout the day. Finally did a workout in the new year (I'm
waiting until Jan 10th before booking all the goals).

Tried "German Volume Training" which is basically 10 sets of 10
reps. Absolutely blasted my pecs. GVT ring dips, bench at 120lbs, push
ups (20 x 5). Each exercise I got to failure before the final
set. Dips was pretty quick, maybe only 2 or 3 sets before hit
failure. Bench by the 6 or 7th. Push ups by the second. Would need to
check exercise log to be sure.

Drove to Tijuana at 7pm and arrived at 9:30pm. Took Leche on a walk
immediately. Had a funny conversation about managing long hair (how it
suuuucks)

** Summary

I woke up pretty late today. Another night of deep sleep. I've been
going to sleep listening to binaural music. I would guess I get an
1-1.5 hours in before the headphones fall out of my ears. Eventually I
wake up and put them on my nightstand.

When I did get out of bed (around 9:15 I think) I went to CVS to get
some shampoo to help with itchy scalp. Since growing my hair out I've
noticed more hair loss. I've attributed this to exercising more which
raises testosterone and DHT simultaneously, DHT being a hair loss
chemical. For a while I thought my itchy scalp was psychosomatic
(still could be) but after looking at pictures of ring worm last night
I really started scratching.

Bought a Head & Shoulders shampoo with menthol to provide some
scratching relief. It worked like a charm. No scratching. Honestly, it
could have been just build up as I wash my hair maybe once every two
weeks. I'll condition it if I break a good sweat. Shampoo really only
after the pool, the ocean or a really good sweat.

Had a call with my old friend from college about 2022 goal
setting. Great to catch up; had been maybe 6 years?

Had the weekly Glow team sync. Partial attendance. Product nearing
beta, excited to get it in real users hands.

Posted two items on craigslist for sale (some white elephant gift
Mariana got and an old 6' surfboard I was waaaay too ambitious
getting. I'm happy using my 8' foam board).

Finalized all the Glow work to sync screenshots. A bit more moving
parts than I thought.

Had a good chat with Tim in slack. Had a call with Riley on the
phone. Nice to talk to so many friends today.

Mariana and I had ramen at the local haunt. Something about today's
bowl was off. Rubbery chicken. One of two eggs I ordered was hard
boiled. Bummer. Left a bad taste in my mouth.

Took Leche on a few short walks. She ate shredded chicken mixed in her
bowl of dog food. She's getting better at fishing out just the stuff
she wants.

I had the last piece of lassagna from NYE for lunch.

Played a little DuoLingo, enough to get 1 crown today.

*** Food
Lassagna, 1 bowl of ramen, 2 eggs, 4oz chicken breast, popcorn +
butter + salt + nutri yeast

*** Drink
12oz tulsi tea (caffeinated, <50mg), 4oz sparkling water, 8oz water,
12oz gingko biloba, 8oz water

100 pushups, dog walks, walking treadmill

** Summary

Energy was pretty sluggish for most of today. Sleep was pretty deep I
felt. Woke up around 8:30am, late considering my first meeting is at
9am. Had a cup of panax ginseng tea and made a smoothy (whey protein,
frozen blueberries, 1cup oatmeal, 1cup milk).

I always overshoot the proportions in a smoothy and wind up with 3x
more than I need.

I'm pretty sure the smoothy or the large amount of it made me
sluggish. Ironic because I have that smoothy with oatmeal because I
think the fiber with help with constant glucose levels. Worth seeing
if I feel this way with just oatmeal + whey + berries + milk.

Had leftover beans & greens for lunch and added shredded chicken I've
been sharing with Leche.

A few focusmate calls today.

At 5:30pm, Mariana and I went to buy wedding rings. We both chose a
simple gold band. Love it.

We ordered Pinches tacos for dinner as we were both hungry. Not the
best. Ordering food in a rush while hungry leads to meh meals.

Worked on the Glow EventBridge problem for an hour (1 focusmate
session) and got data flows working end-to-end. Tomorrow, I'll update
with proper keys and buckets.

Tomorrow we'll have Ramen and finish off any leftovers as we'll drive
to Tijuana on Wednesday night. Staying till sunday night.

Interacted with a fair amount of people on Twitter today, some chatter
around 2021 goals and 24HourHomepage.

Food: smoothy, bean & greans & chicken soup, 3 enchilladas, rice & beans
Drink: 12 oz ginseng tea, 24 oz smoothy, 16oz sparkling water

** Summary
I woke up at 8am to a text from David Sierra-Matos that he and Paulina
were on they way to our house to drop off their dog Karma for our dog
sitting day. Leche was explosive the moment she heard her friend enter
the house. I managed to sleep two more hours before getting up. Only
possible because we put the two puppies in separate rooms. Very playful.

Waiting for Mariana to wake up before brewing my first cup of coffee
in a year. First taste of caffeine really. I noted its effects
[here](https://twitter.com/justinprojects/status/1477748891890040834). Not
going to re-introduce it to my diet regularly as I feel great without
it and too anxious with it.

Nudged several friends about 2022 "dollar challenge". Texted out
details of wedding. Walked dogs twice. Took Leche to the vet for her
required vaccines (for dog boarding).

Cleaned dishes, watched part of Amazing Spider Man 2 (suuuuuuucked),
computer time, rough draft of how to `privatize` partial content of a
file in order to have one log file

Food: 1 piece cardamom coffee cake, 4 hard boiled eggs, Salad with
chicken breast, 1 tangerine, 2 pieces of lassagna

Drink: 8oz coffee, 8oz guava tea, 8oz sparkling water

** Summary

I woke up pretty late today. Another night of deep sleep. I've been
going to sleep listening to binaural music. I would guess I get an
1-1.5 hours in before the headphones fall out of my ears. Eventually I
wake up and put them on my nightstand.

When I did get out of bed (around 9:15 I think) I went to CVS to get
some shampoo to help with itchy scalp. Since growing my hair out I've
noticed more hair loss. I've attributed this to exercising more which
raises testosterone and DHT simultaneously, DHT being a hair loss
chemical. For a while I thought my itchy scalp was psychosomatic
(still could be) but after looking at pictures of ring worm last night
I really started scratching.

Bought a Head & Shoulders shampoo with menthol to provide some
scratching relief. It worked like a charm. No scratching. Honestly, it
could have been just build up as I wash my hair maybe once every two
weeks. I'll condition it if I break a good sweat. Shampoo really only
after the pool, the ocean or a really good sweat.

Had a call with my old friend from college about 2022 goal
setting. Great to catch up; had been maybe 6 years?

Had the weekly Glow team sync. Partial attendance. Product nearing
beta, excited to get it in real users hands.

Posted two items on craigslist for sale (some white elephant gift
Mariana got and an old 6' surfboard I was waaaay too ambitious
getting. I'm happy using my 8' foam board).

Finalized all the Glow work to sync screenshots. A bit more moving
parts than I thought.

Had a good chat with Tim in slack. Had a call with Riley on the
phone. Nice to talk to so many friends today.

Mariana and I had ramen at the local haunt. Something about today's
bowl was off. Rubbery chicken. One of two eggs I ordered was hard
boiled. Bummer. Left a bad taste in my mouth.

Took Leche on a few short walks. She ate shredded chicken mixed in her
bowl of dog food. She's getting better at fishing out just the stuff
she wants.

I had the last piece of lassagna from NYE for lunch.

Played a little DuoLingo, enough to get 1 crown today.

*** Food
Lassagna, 1 bowl of ramen, 2 eggs, 4oz chicken breast, popcorn +
butter + salt + nutri yeast

*** Drink
12oz tulsi tea (caffeinated, <50mg), 4oz sparkling water, 8oz water,
12oz gingko biloba, 8oz water

** Summary

Energy was pretty sluggish for most of today. Sleep was pretty deep I
felt. Woke up around 8:30am, late considering my first meeting is at
9am. Had a cup of panax ginseng tea and made a smoothy (whey protein,
frozen blueberries, 1cup oatmeal, 1cup milk).

I always overshoot the proportions in a smoothy and wind up with 3x
more than I need.

I'm pretty sure the smoothy or the large amount of it made me
sluggish. Ironic because I have that smoothy with oatmeal because I
think the fiber with help with constant glucose levels. Worth seeing
if I feel this way with just oatmeal + whey + berries + milk.

Had leftover beans & greens for lunch and added shredded chicken I've
been sharing with Leche.

A few focusmate calls today.

At 5:30pm, Mariana and I went to buy wedding rings. We both chose a
simple gold band. Love it.

We ordered Pinches tacos for dinner as we were both hungry. Not the
best. Ordering food in a rush while hungry leads to meh meals.

Worked on the Glow EventBridge problem for an hour (1 focusmate
session) and got data flows working end-to-end. Tomorrow, I'll update
with proper keys and buckets.

Tomorrow we'll have Ramen and finish off any leftovers as we'll drive
to Tijuana on Wednesday night. Staying till sunday night.

Interacted with a fair amount of people on Twitter today, some chatter
around 2021 goals and 24HourHomepage.

Food: smoothy, bean & greans & chicken soup, 3 enchilladas, rice & beans
Drink: 12 oz ginseng tea, 24 oz smoothy, 16oz sparkling water

** Summary
I woke up at 8am to a text from David Sierra-Matos that he and Paulina
were on they way to our house to drop off their dog Karma for our dog
sitting day. Leche was explosive the moment she heard her friend enter
the house. I managed to sleep two more hours before getting up. Only
possible because we put the two puppies in separate rooms. Very playful.

Waiting for Mariana to wake up before brewing my first cup of coffee
in a year. First taste of caffeine really. I noted its effects
[here](https://twitter.com/justinprojects/status/1477748891890040834). Not
going to re-introduce it to my diet regularly as I feel great without
it and too anxious with it.

Nudged several friends about 2022 "dollar challenge". Texted out
details of wedding. Walked dogs twice. Took Leche to the vet for her
required vaccines (for dog boarding).

Cleaned dishes, watched part of Amazing Spider Man 2 (suuuuuuucked),
computer time, rough draft of how to `privatize` partial content of a
file in order to have one log file

Food: 1 piece cardamom coffee cake, 4 hard boiled eggs, Salad with
chicken breast, 1 tangerine, 2 pieces of lassagna

Drink: 8oz coffee, 8oz guava tea, 8oz sparkling water

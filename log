** Summary
Today I woke up at 6:30am...then went back to bed... again! Went to
bed around 11-11:30pm or so but no excuse. Just unfocused morning
workout routine and not looking forward to blasting my legs. Will
continue this 3 times per week GVT program until March wedding though.

Had our standup at 9am where two new features were requested from
team. Built both of them today and cleared a few backlog tasks.

Had the shrimp + cabbage for lunch and a couple focusmete
sessions. Mariana got her second offer from the company she
interviewed at accepted a few hours later. Some back and forth
conversation with her about accepting the offer. Her gut was to say
yes but she wanted to talk out some of that decision.

I threw the ball with Leche in our driveway for a few minutes before
we had to head out to pick up our rings. Drove back and started
preparing dinner for Marie who just moved into town (Venice). We
discussed officiating our wedding. Mariana has a few hard rules for
that day which I'll respect.

Took Leche for a walk, came back did my 100 push ups and got Marie on
board for the 2022 yearly goal challenge.

Getting ready for bed though I may work on privatize for a bit.

** Summary

I woke up today at 6:30am but didn't stick it. Went back to bed for
2.5 more hours and finally got up at 9am. Not great. I need to give
myself more time to rest after returning home from a trip, I
underestimate the time to return to return.

Worked on fixing CORS for Albert on Glow as he was blocked. Discovered
an issue with our infrastructure which I patched during our all-hands
then scheduled a larger fix for 7pm-8pm later. The actual fix took
about 80minutes to fix because I had to destroy several AWS resources
before spinning up new ones.

I mailed the remainder of our wedding deposit to SF City Hall and
talked with Mariana about her job offers and prospects.

Sat down a few times today as returning to the standing desk treadmill
after 5 days off (and no exercise) was tiring. The knees feel it first
for some reason.

Had some fake chicken nuggets for lunch and a couple cucumbers. Made a
shrimp stir fry (green and purple cabbage, carrots, shrimp, garlic,
ginger) for dinner.

Took Leche on a walk to pick up Mariana from ceramics. On the walk we
passed a dog owner with his dog on a date outside Madre the mexican
restaurant. I stopped before passing with Leche and asked if it was
safe to pass the doberman who looked set on attacking Leche. He said
"yeah, he's friendly" but then had to pull him off as he lunged toward
her. Not cool.

Came home to wind down. Doing my push ups now before we finish the
last episode of MindHunter and hit the hay.

** Summary

I woke up later today, probably around 9:30am or so. It's MLK day so
we had the day off and took advantage of that by sleeping in. I shared
the Spanish version of Wordle with Mariana and Maru. They both liked it.

I took Leche on her morning walk and returned to eat an omelette Maru
had made. 3-egg with asparagus and bell peppers and a chipotle cream
sauce. Delicious.

Dropped my car off to get it washed. Maru had a coupon which
apparently made it free.

I was a bit dizzy this morning. Odd. Not from any motion or
activity. Just a persistent feeling of dizziness for about 90minutes
in the morning. I was kind of worried by it so had a cup of black tea
thinking the vasodialating effects of caffeine would help. Maybe they
did. Maybe it was psychosomatic.

Afterward we went to pick up shoes for the wedding from BBB. Found
some nice ones with a squared/round toe. Mariana noticed a suit vendor
on our way out and said we should check it out. We went to Samborns
first to check if they sold the Spanish version of "Watch ya Mouth"
(the game we played during the holidays). They didn't. Went to a Torta
shop afterward. Had a milanesa which was too rubbery for my
tastes. Split flautas with Maru also who agreed they were too cold.

We went to the suit vendor afterward and tried on three suit
sizes. Two suit styles total. After much back and forth we bought the
all black suit with a white shirt. It will be slightly altered to make
the waste tighter and the legs longer. Suit, shirt and pocket square
were all less than $200 USD. Everyone was pretty impressed with
that. At that price I could wear a suit every day.

Returned home to pick up the car. Didn't know the coupon was for a
free service (I figured a discount). Returned home and packed car to
head back to LA.

Got back around 8:30pm and took Leche for her night-time walk. Had two
gorditas, about a cup of blueberries and two glasses of milk for
dinner.

We watched two episodes of MindHunter and have one remaining. Will
watch that this weekend probably.

Tomorrow, I'd like to wake up to do another leg day exercise and then
do the next task on the rewardful migration.

* 01/16/2022
** Summary

Today I woke up at 9:30am for breakfast with Mariana's
family. Breaksfast was scheduled for 11am so everyone showed up at
noon. We had gorditas from "Las Delicias" the breakfast spot we
love. Delicious.

Everyone stayed and chatted until about 4pm. Rafaella, Mariana's
neice, is crawling now and like to climb the stairs. We climbed with
her to make sure she didn't fall. She like feeding Leche crackers. I
took her to look at the other dogs (from through the screen
door). They seemed fine with her but when I bent down with her to wave
at them, they barked and scared her. Close call, nobody likes to make
baby cry.

Took Leche on a walk after everyone left and then stayed downstairs
and played with node's crypto package to encrypt streams from stdin. I
think I have all the pieces to make privatize. Some code
organizational questions to answer first (where does the key live?
user specified? an ignored dot file?

We had comida china for dinner. Noticably as good as Americanized
Chinese food. Took Leche on another walk to see if she would poop (did
not). Returned and did the dishes.

Going to watch more MindHunter before bed

** Summary
I woke up at 8:30am today after attempting to watch a few episodes of
"Mindhunter" in bed last night with Mariana. Didn't get very far
before falling asleep. Pretty vivid dreams again.

We drove to Tecate to book the wedding venue for June. Met the event
manager who seemed more professional in person than over email. Drove
back to TJ, more traffic than usual.

Stayed at the house for a bit before going to Analeh's parents house
for an asada. Delicious meat, not sure what (if anything) it was
marinated in but muy sabrosa. We played simple game of chance called
"contento" where in you are dealt a card and have the choice to either
keep the card or switch with the person to your right unless you are
the last person in the turn in which case you can keep yours or switch
with the top card in the deck. The lowest card loses. Simple rules and
fun for the whole family.

The power went out in playas and so we talked by candle light for a
while. Around 10:00pm we packed it up and went home but were invited
to hang out at the airbnb for a bit before heading home. First we
brought Leche but then were unsure how she would be with the two dogs
at the house, so we brought her back. The airbnb was right around the
corner, so nbd.

One of the dogs at the airbnb was obsessed with playing fetch. He
wouldn't take no for an answer, kept dropping his ball in Alan
(Analeh's boyfriend) lap. I wanted to tire the dog out so through it
12 consecutive times before the dog tapped out.

We returned at midnight and might watch a show before bed, not much
obligations tomorrow other than breakfast at the house. Lazy Sunday.

** Summary
I woke up at 6:30am today but re-set it for 7:15am. I think in order
for this rise before sunrise thing to work I need to declare what I
need to do within the first 15minutes of my alarm going off. There are
also services like BeeMinder which will take your money if you don't
do your stated goal.

Worked on Glow all day, had a call with half the team about the zombie
problem. Turns out the chat based solution won't work since we can't
add an SDK to a widget. We've got a possible solution but will need to
prototype one thing next week to see it through. It might mean two new
(hairy) systems on the backend.

Had a delicious chipotle cream salmon with rice for dinner. Talked
with Pablo about different sales projects.

Returned upstairs to finish the deploy. While it was deploying did
some product research and responded to emails.

The rest of tonight and (parts of this weekend), I'll work on the
rewardful migration.

** Summary

Woke up at 6:30am but didn't have a plan so walked around the house
and went back to lie in bed to recall my dreams. Didn't
work. Eventually got out of bed at 7:15am, did a DuoLingo session and
responded to two pings at work.

Took Leche on a walk, ate frittata from yesterday and cottage cheese +
blueberries. Added some cottage cheese to Leche's food, she ate it
right up.

Had a call with Kevin Favro to discuss 2022 goals. Great to catch up
with him. Worked on Glow features (waitlist, zombie X problem) and
unblocked the zombie problem. Will test that on Friday.

Went to the bank at lunch to withdraw cash for the wedding deposit on
Saturday.

Packed and was on the road for TJ by 6:30pm. Arrived around
9pm. Stopped at Jack in the Box and ate chicken strips and fries for
dinner. Good but pretty oily, would've been nice to have some clean
food to degrease my mouth.

Took Leche for a poop walk when we got to TJ. Spent about 40min on
DuoLingo in bed and forgot to check-in this daily summary.

** Summary

I woke up at 6:30am this morning and did my DuoLingo sessions while
waking up. I started my workout by 7:15am and finished by
8:15am. Another GVT (10x10) chest day, this time I superset my
exercises and tried to do a 4010 rhythm for the bench. I dropped the
weight to 100lbs so that I could do the full volume without hitting
failure. Not bad at all, chest wasn't nearly as on fire as last time.

Had beetroot powder mixed in water again. Maybe that helped with
indurance too.

Had about 30min before work to work on a 24HourHomepage feature (react
form to post affiliate data). Hoping to get some time on Saturday to
finish it up before deploying next week.

Finished out the waitlist Glow features.

At lunch hour I refilled our water and bought some fruit from Trader
Joes. Confirmed with venue that handing them money (and get receipt)
is best route forward (bank account number they gave was missing one
digit).

Threw the ball with Leche after work and went on a few walks with her
today. Going on one more right now before bed.

Will read more of crypto101.com (research `privatize`) for before
going to sleep.

** Summary

I woke up this morning at 6:30am. A bit easier today even though legs
are still jelly from yesterday's leg workout. Had beetroot powder in
8oz of water on an empty stomach. Noticeable flushness in chest, not
as strong as I antcipated though. Beet "juice" wasn't as bad as I
thought. Did my 100 push ups early and DuoLingo early too.

Before work I started to migrate off Rewardful for
24HourHomepage.com's affiliate program. It's too expensive and hasn't
yielded the right results for cost. I emailed their team with an
offer: let me use the product for free in exchange for 5% percent of
each affiliate sale made. They replied quickly and seemed kind of
upset from the tone of their reply.

Took Leche on her walk at 9:00am. Worked out Glow features (spec'd out
waitlist and started work on APIs).

Asked Jered & Jacqueline for suit recommendations; they gave some good
ones.

At lunch, went to bank to pick up cashier's check for wedding.

After work sold old surfboard I bought two years ago (prefer the big
beginner boards we have).

Made pan salmon and roasted brussel sprouts for dinner. Caught up with
Tony Askar for a while about life and 2022 goals. Nice to catch up.

It's 9:30pm and I'm pretty wiped again. Gonna hit the hay.

Tomorrow morning I'd like to get a functional (unstyled, posting to an
api) affiliate form working before work.

** Summary

Today I woke up at 6:30am and started my workout by 7:15am. Pretty
zombie like for the first 45min of the day. Not really tired just
waking up. Sort of dragging my feet to do the 10x10 lifts.

I didn't do 10x10 leg day but did 5x10 (5 sets, 10 reps) of squat
(120lbs), bulgarian split squats (bodyweight), deadlift (120lbs) and
one leg "bow-erianas" (bodyweight). Took Leche on a walk before work.

Deployed last weeks features and hit the backlog. Got three small
tasks done and commented on a few features. One big one: we may need
some video processing on the backend. TBD.

My legs were jelly today after the workout. Threw the ball with Leche
in the driveway for a bit.

Re-watched part of Matrix 4 while eating dinner.

Passively researched a new product.

** Summary

After watching two episodes of Mindhunter until 1am last night, we
slept in until 10am, well rested. Took Leche on a short walk to the
ATM. She had already gone on her bathroom walk with Leo earlier.

We went to "Las Delicias" for desayunos. I ordered chiliquiles rojos
con dos huevos y una gordita con carne on the side. Delicious. Maybe I
just order the gorditas next time, 3 of them.

After that, we came home and had tea before packing to return to
LA. We filled up on gas and the lady who pumped the gas managed to
fill it up way past the original auto-stop of the pump. From 725 pesos
to 950 pesos.

The drive back to LA was pretty fast. Listened to several planet money
podcasts while Mariana and Leche slept. When we got home, we took
Leche for a walk and watched more Mindhunter (the rest of season 1)
until 12:00am.

It's a gripping show but I'm glad it's only two seasons.

** Summary
(Writing this on 01/09/2022)

I woke up without an alarm clock around 10am or so. Great feeling to
have every now and then.

A nice lazy day. Took Leche for her morning bathroom walk. Returned to
eat a spinach and cheese omelete. Had an fresh squeeze orange juice
with the meal.

Made an 10oz cup of gingko biloba tea and chat with Maru while Mariana
got ready to go meet the wedding photographer downtown.

Photographer (Valeria) was very friendly and asked lots of questions
about us and the day of. Paid our deposit and will pay the rest on
wedding day.

Returned to Playas, took Leche for another walk and to ATM before
heading out for dinner and the nights entertainment: an old singer
friend of Maru's giving a performance with her band. Sang mostly 60s,
70s, 80s songs en Ingles. We were early and walked around downtown for
a little but returned to wait in the car where it was warmer.

Before the show we ate at cevicheria "Nice". Delicious. I think I
should only get the tuna tostada from now on. It's insanely good. The
tacos were pale in comparison (and I tried 4 different types)

After a few hours (maybe a dozen songs) we returned home to an excited
Leche who I took for her night walk. We started to watch "Mindhunter"
a Netflix show I'd heard good things from David Fincher fans.

Watched two episodes before falling asleep. At some point in the
second episode Maru spilled Mariana's hot chocolate she rested on the
headboard. We paused to change the sheets and clean the chocolate
mattress stain.

Went to bed around 1:30am. Leche slept in Maru's room on top of Maru.


*** Food

Spinach, cheese, omelette with avocado and tomatoes on the side. 2.25
tuna tostadas, 1 taco pescado (frita), 1 taco de camerone, 1 taco de
pulpo "chicharon", 1 taco de marlin.

*** Drink
8oz orange juice, 10oz te gingko biloba, 8oz te verde, 12oz clamato
sin cerveza, 12oz agua mineral

*** Fitness
Dog walks

Need to figure out what the 100 push ups challenge is if I intend to
do serious chest routines. I think I just do it anyway or give myself
a few options to choose from (100 push ups OR 100 air squats OR 5 min
mountain climbers)

Today I woke up at 7am for call with Dad, had to reschedule due to
extreme weather in Oregon (power outage). I could have stayed up then
but slept in until 9am. Really deep sleep these last few weeks. Maybe
the cold, maybe the post goal rest? Stopped listening to those
binaural beats and I'm still getting great rest. Awesome.

Finished most of the the "polishing" glow feature today. Need to sync
with Charles tomorrow about some edge cases.

Had the "Rosca de Reyes" party tonight. Mariana hecho dos roscas y
eran delicioso. Yo recibi el bebe y necessito pagar para las tamales
(o la fiesta proxima?). We ate frijoles, tamales y papas. Delicous.

Took Leche on her evening walk. Lots of protective dogs in the
neighborhood. Some are so jacked up they look like they'll bust full
out the gate that holds them to get Leche. She was only afraid of the
big pit bull looking ones (maybe because of her pitbull incident).

Came home and am going to bed early.

Yesterday I...

Yesterday finished the Glow feature and had mostly focused, good
energy throughout the day. Finally did a workout in the new year (I'm
waiting until Jan 10th before booking all the goals).

Tried "German Volume Training" which is basically 10 sets of 10
reps. Absolutely blasted my pecs. GVT ring dips, bench at 120lbs, push
ups (20 x 5). Each exercise I got to failure before the final
set. Dips was pretty quick, maybe only 2 or 3 sets before hit
failure. Bench by the 6 or 7th. Push ups by the second. Would need to
check exercise log to be sure.

Drove to Tijuana at 7pm and arrived at 9:30pm. Took Leche on a walk
immediately. Had a funny conversation about managing long hair (how it
suuuucks)

** Summary

I woke up pretty late today. Another night of deep sleep. I've been
going to sleep listening to binaural music. I would guess I get an
1-1.5 hours in before the headphones fall out of my ears. Eventually I
wake up and put them on my nightstand.

When I did get out of bed (around 9:15 I think) I went to CVS to get
some shampoo to help with itchy scalp. Since growing my hair out I've
noticed more hair loss. I've attributed this to exercising more which
raises testosterone and DHT simultaneously, DHT being a hair loss
chemical. For a while I thought my itchy scalp was psychosomatic
(still could be) but after looking at pictures of ring worm last night
I really started scratching.

Bought a Head & Shoulders shampoo with menthol to provide some
scratching relief. It worked like a charm. No scratching. Honestly, it
could have been just build up as I wash my hair maybe once every two
weeks. I'll condition it if I break a good sweat. Shampoo really only
after the pool, the ocean or a really good sweat.

Had a call with my old friend from college about 2022 goal
setting. Great to catch up; had been maybe 6 years?

Had the weekly Glow team sync. Partial attendance. Product nearing
beta, excited to get it in real users hands.

Posted two items on craigslist for sale (some white elephant gift
Mariana got and an old 6' surfboard I was waaaay too ambitious
getting. I'm happy using my 8' foam board).

Finalized all the Glow work to sync screenshots. A bit more moving
parts than I thought.

Had a good chat with Tim in slack. Had a call with Riley on the
phone. Nice to talk to so many friends today.

Mariana and I had ramen at the local haunt. Something about today's
bowl was off. Rubbery chicken. One of two eggs I ordered was hard
boiled. Bummer. Left a bad taste in my mouth.

Took Leche on a few short walks. She ate shredded chicken mixed in her
bowl of dog food. She's getting better at fishing out just the stuff
she wants.

I had the last piece of lassagna from NYE for lunch.

Played a little DuoLingo, enough to get 1 crown today.

*** Food
Lassagna, 1 bowl of ramen, 2 eggs, 4oz chicken breast, popcorn +
butter + salt + nutri yeast

*** Drink
12oz tulsi tea (caffeinated, <50mg), 4oz sparkling water, 8oz water,

** Summary

Energy was pretty sluggish for most of today. Sleep was pretty deep I
felt. Woke up around 8:30am, late considering my first meeting is at
9am. Had a cup of panax ginseng tea and made a smoothy (whey protein,
frozen blueberries, 1cup oatmeal, 1cup milk).

I always overshoot the proportions in a smoothy and wind up with 3x
more than I need.

I'm pretty sure the smoothy or the large amount of it made me
sluggish. Ironic because I have that smoothy with oatmeal because I
think the fiber with help with constant glucose levels. Worth seeing
if I feel this way with just oatmeal + whey + berries + milk.

Had leftover beans & greens for lunch and added shredded chicken I've
been sharing with Leche.

A few focusmate calls today.

At 5:30pm, Mariana and I went to buy wedding rings. We both chose a
simple gold band. Love it.

We ordered Pinches tacos for dinner as we were both hungry. Not the
best. Ordering food in a rush while hungry leads to meh meals.

Worked on the Glow EventBridge problem for an hour (1 focusmate
session) and got data flows working end-to-end. Tomorrow, I'll update
with proper keys and buckets.

Tomorrow we'll have Ramen and finish off any leftovers as we'll drive
to Tijuana on Wednesday night. Staying till sunday night.

Interacted with a fair amount of people on Twitter today, some chatter
around 2021 goals and 24HourHomepage.

Food: smoothy, bean & greans & chicken soup, 3 enchilladas, rice & beans
Drink: 12 oz ginseng tea, 24 oz smoothy, 16oz sparkling water

** Summary
I woke up at 8am to a text from David Sierra-Matos that he and Paulina
were on they way to our house to drop off their dog Karma for our dog
sitting day. Leche was explosive the moment she heard her friend enter
the house. I managed to sleep two more hours before getting up. Only
possible because we put the two puppies in separate rooms. Very playful.

Waiting for Mariana to wake up before brewing my first cup of coffee
in a year. First taste of caffeine really. I noted its effects
[here](https://twitter.com/justinprojects/status/1477748891890040834). Not
going to re-introduce it to my diet regularly as I feel great without
it and too anxious with it.

Nudged several friends about 2022 "dollar challenge". Texted out
details of wedding. Walked dogs twice. Took Leche to the vet for her
required vaccines (for dog boarding).

Cleaned dishes, watched part of Amazing Spider Man 2 (suuuuuuucked),
computer time, rough draft of how to `privatize` partial content of a
file in order to have one log file

Food: 1 piece cardamom coffee cake, 4 hard boiled eggs, Salad with
chicken breast, 1 tangerine, 2 pieces of lassagna

Drink: 8oz coffee, 8oz guava tea, 8oz sparkling water

** Summary
I woke up at 8am to a text from David Sierra-Matos that he and Paulina
were on they way to our house to drop off their dog Karma for our dog
sitting day. Leche was explosive the moment she heard her friend enter
the house. I managed to sleep two more hours before getting up. Only
possible because we put the two puppies in separate rooms. Very playful.

Waiting for Mariana to wake up before brewing my first cup of coffee
in a year. First taste of caffeine really. I noted its effects
[here](https://twitter.com/justinprojects/status/1477748891890040834). Not
going to re-introduce it to my diet regularly as I feel great without
it and too anxious with it.

Nudged several friends about 2022 "dollar challenge". Texted out
details of wedding. Walked dogs twice. Took Leche to the vet for her
required vaccines (for dog boarding).

Cleaned dishes, watched part of Amazing Spider Man 2 (suuuuuuucked),
computer time, rough draft of how to `privatize` partial content of a
file in order to have one log file

Food: 1 piece cardamom coffee cake, 4 hard boiled eggs, Salad with
chicken breast, 1 tangerine, 2 pieces of lassagna

Drink: 8oz coffee, 8oz guava tea, 8oz sparkling water
